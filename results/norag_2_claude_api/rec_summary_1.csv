"ATCM12_R1.txt","XII-1","The Collection and Distribution of Antarctic Meteorological Data","0","None","2","VI-3 | X-3","This recommendation reaffirms the importance of collecting and distributing Antarctic meteorological data in a timely manner to support operations, weather forecasting and research. It recommends that governments maintain and improve the network of meteorological stations and data transmission systems in Antarctica, and work with the World Meteorological Organization to keep the data exchange arrangements under review."
"ATCM12_R2.txt","XII-2","Antarctic Telecommunications","0","None","3","VI-1 | VII-7 | X-3","This recommendation calls for effective use of existing Antarctic telecommunications systems and utilization of developing satellite communications to improve communications between Antarctic stations and with the outside world. It invites SCAR to consider how to keep the Antarctic Telecommunications Guidance Manual (SCARCOM) updated, examine issues related to increased use of satellite communications, and assess the adequacy of the telecommunications system to support expanding shipping and aircraft activity in Antarctica."
"ATCM12_R3.txt","XII-3","Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment","1","II","4","VI-4 | VIII-11 | VIII-13 | IX-5","Recommends that Consultative Parties scrutinize plans for scientific and logistic activities to determine potential environmental impacts, conduct detailed environmental assessments if significant impacts are likely, and invite SCAR to provide scientific advice on categories of activities expected to have significant environmental impact and on assessment procedures. Calls for further consideration of man's impact on the Antarctic environment at the next Consultative Meeting."
"ATCM12_R4.txt","XII-4","Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment - Code of Conduct for Antarctic Expeditions and Station Activities","0","None","1","VIII-11","Recommendation XII-4 calls on Consultative Parties to seek advice from their Antarctic operating agencies on any problems experienced in implementing the Code of Conduct for Antarctic Expeditions and Station Activities from Recommendation VIII-11, and on the desirability and feasibility of revising the Code in light of increased awareness of environmental impacts, the introduction of potentially damaging substances, and improvements in waste treatment and removal capabilities."
"ATCM12_R5.txt","XII-5","Sites of Special Scientific Interest","0","None","4","VIII-3 | VIII-4 | X-6 | VIII-3","Recommends extending the expiry dates to 31 December 1985 for several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (Sites 1-8) to allow SCAR to complete a comprehensive review of the sites and present the results to the Consultative Parties for consideration at the Thirteenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in 1985. Also recommends using best endeavours to ensure the management plans of these sites are observed."
"ATCM12_R6.txt","XII-6","Operation of the Antarctic Treaty System","1","III","1","I-XIV","This recommendation aims to increase involvement of non-Consultative Parties in the Antarctic Treaty System, raise public awareness of the System's achievements, and encourage cooperation with relevant UN agencies and international organizations.
