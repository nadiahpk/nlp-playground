THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

The Representatives,

Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty, Recommendations
VI-4, VIII-11, VIII-13 and IX-5;

Noting that in these Recommendations, which have become
effective in accordance with Article IX, Paragraph 4 of the
Antarctic Treaty, certain principles were elaborated and
adopted, namely that:

(i)     the ecosystem of the Antarctic Treaty Area is vulnerable
        to human interference;

(ii)    the Antarctic derives much of its scientific importance
        from its uncontaminated and relatively undisturbed
        condition;

(iii)   in considering measures for the wise use and protection
        of the Antarctic environment their Governments shall act
        in accordance with their responsibility for ensuring that
        such measures are consistent with the interests of all
        mankind;

(iv)    no act or activity having an inherent tendency to modify
        the environment over wide areas within the Antarctic
        Treaty Area should be undertaken unless appropriate steps
        have been taken to foresee the probable modifications and
        to exercise appropriate controls with respect to the
        harmful effects such uses of the Antarctic Treaty Area
