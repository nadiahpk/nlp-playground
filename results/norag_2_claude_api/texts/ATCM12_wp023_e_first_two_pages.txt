(Submitted to Plenary by the Telecommunications Working Group)

[Antarctic Treaty emblem figure]

ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations VI-1, VII-7 and X-3;

Recognising that Antarctic telecommunications are designed to
carry operational, scientific and meteorological traffic and
that improvement of the telecommunications system would serve to
ensure timely and full exchange of information;

Recognising that recent developments in the use of satellites,
of which some Consultative Parties have made use, have improved
the reliability of communication links between Antarctic
stations and the outside world, but that consequent diminished
reliance on conventional telecommunication methods may have
affected the capability of stations to communicate with each
other;

Noting with appreciation, the response of the SCAR Working Group
on Logistics to the request in Recommendation X-3, paragraph 6,
to prepare an Antarctic Telecommunications Guidance Manual
(SCARCOM);

Noting that the increasing shipping and aircraft activity in
Antarctica will require improved telecommunications and
meteorological support by Consultative Parties undertaking such
increased activity;
