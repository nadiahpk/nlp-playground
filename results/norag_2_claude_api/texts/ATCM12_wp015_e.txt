The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendation X-3;

Having received with great pleasure and attention Volumes I and
II of the Manual of the S.C.A.R. Logistics Group, which
constitutes a technical effort deserving to be tested to assess
its content and to be constantly updated in order to satisfy
the ends to which it has been prepared;

Recognising that the Antarctic region and the Antarctic continent
itself represent a vast area of the Southern Hemisphere
generating meteorological phenomena that exert considerable
influence over the climate of the remaining continents;

Bearing in mind that the number of meteorological stations
existing in Antarctica are small in relation to the size of the
region and, in many cases, are concentrated in certain areas
having easy access by sea;

Considering that, consequently, there exists no rationally
distributed network of meteorological data-receiving stations
throughout the length and breadth of the whole continent to
cover the need for information on the evolution of meteorological
phenomena and their influence on the weather forecasts of the
region and other areas of the Southern Hemisphere;

Recognising that an optimal distribution of stations constitutes
a solution which is scarcely feasible and would, furthermore,
represent high installation costs;

Taking into account, moreover, that the efficiency of existing
networks, both for data collection and for the transmission
of meteorological information from each station to the other
bases, to vessels operating in the Southern Ocean and to aircraft

flying in the region, could be improved in the future, as it
has been in the past and to-date, by incorporating the most
advanced technology to this effect;

Having been informed that many of the climatic phenomena
recorded in some stations are related only to "micro-climates"
or local phenomena and bear no relation to the global
meteorological phenomena of the region;

Accepting that every possible and necessary effort should be
made to ensure an efficient and timely exchange of meteorological
data in a reliable manner;

RECOMMEND to their Governments that:

1.     They introduce bilateral and multilateral improvements
to the operating conditions of respective telecommunications
networks, to ensure the timely transmission of meteorological
data to existing bases and stations in Antarctica, as well
as to vessels and aircraft operating in the region.

2.     They congratulate S.C.A.R. for the major work carried
out on the SCARCOM "Antarctic Telecommunications Guidance
Manual, Volumes I and II".

3.     They adhere to the most reliable telecommunications
procedures, including the use of satellites, in order to avoid
delays and inconveniences as well as omissions.

4.     They consider, for the installation of new bases and
meteorological stations, a more rational distribution throughout
the length and breadth of Antarctica, in order to establish a
network of stations of optimal performance to cover the
greatest possible area of the continent.

5.     They recognise the need to simultaneously transmit
meteorological data from the Antarctic stations to the data-
collecting networks of the W.M.O., and to detect existing
faults which cause a proportion of this data to be lost
in the current telecommunications networks.
