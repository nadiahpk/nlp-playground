ITEM 6. IMPACT OF MAN ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT
(Working Document submitted by the Delegations of
             Chile and Argentina)

Under the Antarctic Treaty regime, the impact of Man and his
activities on the environment of that continent have always been of
special concern.

The expression of that concern has been embodied in the different
recommendations that have been adopted in relation to it. In these
recommendations, together with Agreed Measures for the protection of the
Antarctic environment, the Consultative Parties have committed themselves
to protect that environment from any harmful human interference, and have
assumed the responsibility for informing the international community of any
major change deriving from human activities carried out in the Antarctic
Treaty zone (Recommendations VI-4; VII-1; VIII-11; VIII-13; IX-5; X-4
and X-6 respectively).

As noted, the activities that Man has been carrying out in Antarctica
pursuant to the 1959 Washington Treaty are duly regulated by those afore-
mentioned Recommendations and by other Recommendations which, without making
specific reference to this subject, serve also to control human activities
such as tourism and non-governmental expeditions to those zones. These
activities are subject to their own Regulations.

However, current and future activities in those regions in application
of the Conventions adopted under the Antarctic System (Convention for the
Conservation of Antarctic Seals; Convention for the Conservation of
Antarctic Marine Living Resources; the future regime for the exploration and
exploitation of Antarctic Mineral Resources which is presently under study),
have not been the subject of any specific examination under those policies
agreed in accordance with the Antarctic Treaty regime. In spite of this,
it should be mentioned that the Consultative Parties have shown special
concern with regard to Man's impact on the Antarctic environment in relation
to a future regime for the exploration and exploitation of the Antarctic
Mineral Resources. This concern was reflected in the Final Report of the
IX Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

In the light of the above, and in accordance with the major role of
the Consultative Parties on the subject, it is felt that they should continue
to make it their concern that such activities are also included in the
measures for the protection and preservation of the Antarctic environment
foreseen by the Washington Treaty in its role as an instrument governing
human activities in these zones.

In accordance with the above, it seems advisable that a special item
on this topic be included on the Agenda of the XII Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting with a view to studying the draft Recommendation given
below. The text of the resolution has deliberately been left open so that
it might be completed during the discussions to take place during the XII
Consultative Meeting.

"The Representatives

Considering the vulnerability of the Antarctic environment to
human interference and recalling that major alterations of that environment
would have negative consequences with world-wide repercussions;

Recognizing the undertaking of the Consultatives Parties to protect
the Antarctic environment against all harmful human interference, in
accordance with the Declaration in Recommendation VIII-13;

Taking into consideration that by way of numerous Recommendations
such as: VI-4; VII-1; VIII-11; VIII-13; IX-5, X-4; X-5 and X-6, measures
to preserve and safeguard the Antarctic environment against Man's presence
therein, have been adopted in compliance with the responsibility assumed
by the Consultative Parties;

Reiterating the relationship existing between the protection of the
Antarctic environment and of its dependent ecosystems with the regimes for
the utilization of resources;

Taking into consideration the measures for the protection of the Antarctic environment in the Convention for Antarctic Marine Living Resources, in Recommendation XI-1 on mineral resources and in other pertinent recommendations;

Mindful of, among others, the studies carried out by SCAR, by a group of experts appointed by the Consultative Parties and of those studies that are being carried out under the auspices of SCAR;

Mindful that the activities taking place in Antarctica which derive from the application of international agreements arising within the Antarctic System should be covered by the above-mentioned Recommendations;

Declare that, in accordance with the commitment undertaken in Recommendation IX-5, it is the Consultative Parties' duty to see that the activities carried out by Man in Antarctica in application of the new existing international agreements or of agreements arising within the Antarctic System, do not have a harmful impact on the Antarctic environment; and

Recommend to their governments that:

(a) they adopt the necessary measures so that all activities derived from the international agreements of the Antarctic System are carried out according to the Recommendations already adopted, and those being adopted to such effect, in fulfilment of the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty;

(b) they make the necessary efforts so that, in the new international agreements to be adopted within the Antarctic System, the measures to ensure the observance of the Recommendations controlling Man's impact on the Antarctic environment are included;

(c) they urge that the appropriate steps be taken for completion of the studies with regard to the possible effects of future mineral
