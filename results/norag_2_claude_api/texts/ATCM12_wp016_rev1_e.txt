EXPLANATORY NOTE AND DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

The First Indian Expedition to Antarctica landed on
Antarctica on 9 January 1982 along the coast of Dronning Maud
Land. After landing, the expedition team crossed the ice shelf,
and about 80 kilometres inside, selected a site in the hilly
terrain of Wohlthat Mountains for setting up a solar-powered,
automatic weather station. It was named as "Dakshin Gangotri".
A large, suitable in situ rock was selected and its exact
position was recorded using satellite position fixing system
(JMR). The exact coordinates of Dakshin Gangotri were Latitude
70째 45' 12.963"S and Longitude 11째 38' 13.618"E. A brass
plaque commemorating the landing of the First Indian Expedition
was permanently cemented on the selected rock and the Indian
National Flag was hoisted on the plaque-bearing rock. The
plaque gives the name of the station, the names of all members
of the team along with their institutions. The site and plaque
are of much importance and form a prominent landmark in the area
with an adjoining freshwater lake. The plaque-bearing rock is
now considered a historial monument as it signifies the first
landing of India's expedition.
