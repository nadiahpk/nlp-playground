The preservation and conservation of the living
resources of Antarctica have been a major concern of the
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs) since the
establishment of the Antarctic Treaty. Article IX of the
Treaty specifically lists this concern among the principles
and objectives of the Treaty.

In the years since the Treaty same into force there
has emerged an evolving system of recommendations and
conventions building on this concern expressed in Article
IX-l(f). Essentially these measures have been developed
in recognition of:

(i) the need to avoid unnecessary interferenc- with the
natural ecological system which is not sufficiently understood
and continues to be the subject of research

(ii) the need to protect Antarctica from pollution by
waste disposal to preserve it as an area for global baseline
monitoring purposes

(iii) the role of Antarctica as a major influence on the
global climate

(iv) the possibility of overfishing in Antarctic waters
and the desire to protect the integrity of the Antarctic
ecosystem

(v) the scientific importance of the study of Antarctic
fauna and flora, their unique nature, adaption to the
rigorous environment, interrelationship with their
surroundings and their defencelessness and susceptibility
to extermination

(vi) the importance of areas used for scientific research
and areas of historical interest.

The conventions that have been drawn up are:

(i) The Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic
Flora and Fauna;

(ii) The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic
Seals; and

(iii) The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic
Marine Living Resources.

In addition recommendations on man's activities
have been made with respect to:

(i) conduct of Antarctic expeditions and station
activities (Rec VIII-11).

(ii) effects of tourism (especially Rec VIII-9, X-8).

(iii) protection of historic sites and monuments
(especially Rec VI-14).

(iv) promotion of research of the Antarctic ecosystem,
oil contamination, effects of mineral resource activities
on Antarctica.

(v) protection of specified areas of research from
man's activities by the establishing of sites of special
scientific interest (Recs VIII-3 and 4).

(vi) conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora by

2

protection from unregulated killing, harmful intereference
by man or the introduction of non indigenous species,
parasites and disease and by the establishment of areas
giving wildlife special protection (especially Rec III-
VIII).

(vii) conservation and rational management of Antarctic
seals (especially Rec IV-21 which was the basis for the
Convention on the Conservation of Seals).

(viii) conservation and rational management of Antarctic
marine living resources (especially Rec IX-2) which led to
the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources.

These existing conventions and recommendations
provide protection for Antarctic fauna and flora, ensure the
conservation of Antarctic marine living resources including
seals, and constitute guidelines and directions for minimising
man's impact on the Antarctic ecosystem.

In addition there is currently being developed an
Antarctic minerals regime that necessarily will contain
measures for environmental protection. These measures,
while building on the existing environmental protection
measures, will most likely, in some instances, be more
specific and possibly more rigorous than those now in
existence. In addition, because of the need to deal with
minerals regime matters in a unified manner, it will be
necessary for the regime to provide for a self-contained
system of environmental protection measures. Whether
these are contained in the minerals regime convention, or
are developed through procedures contained in that
convention remains to be seen. However it is most likely

that the minerals regime will contain a set of environmental
safeguards that are separate from and complementary to the
existing combination of measures.

The present system of measures has evolved in parallel
with both increasing awareness of the environmental
consequences of man's activities and the increase in man-s
presence and the range of his activities in Antarctica.
Because of this evolutionary process we are now in a
situation where we have a combination of hortatory measures
and others requiring legislation providing protection for
various components of the Antarctic environment.

While taken together this combination of measures
constitutes a fairly comprehensive system of environmental
protection, it is overall a piecemeal system that requires
constant attention to ensure that it is adequate to cover
the increas-ng scope of Antarctic activities.

An examination of this combination of environmental
protection measures, with its various levels and degrees of
specificity and complexity, strongly suggests that there is
a need for a review of some kind to draw them all together,
possibly with some degree of rationalisation and development.
At the Preparatory Meeting in April the United Kingdom
circulated an informal paper suggesting that it may be time
for ATCPs to consider an overall set of measures for
environmental protection.

Chile has proposed a Recommendation (Ant/XII/PREP/8/
Rev. 1) reflecting concern that the likely increase in man's
activity arising from existing and proposed conventions
will not be adequately controlled by the existing system of
environmental protection measures.

While it is one thing to acknowledge the arguments
that exist for an overall system of measures for the
protection of the environment, it is another matter to
determine the optimum form and extent of such measures.
Careful study of the existing system and of the demands
likely to be placed on it by future developments will be
necessary. In particular it would be necessary to examine
the possible overlap or conflict between different measures:
an example would be offshore minerals activities where aspects
of CCAMLR, the minerals regime and the Agreed Measures for
the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora could all be
involved.

A possible starting point would be for operating
nations to begin assessing the impacts of new developments
so as to build up a body of knowledge and expertise on this
subject. We therefore support the UK proposal for the
adoption of Interim Guideline Procedures.

Concurrently attention should be directed to
studying the nature of changes that might be made to the
system of environmental protection measures in order to
achieve optimum effectiveness. Options that might be
considered include:

(i)       retaining the existing conventions as they are and
examining the adoption of new recommendations rationalising
and therefore superseding existing recommendations to
reflect current and forseeable circumstances;

(ii)      while retaining some or all existing conventions
develop new measures to respond to the increasing scope
and complexity of man's activities. These new measures
could be implemented as a new Agreed Measures (to be

convention would subsume previous measures and would lay
down standards to which later conventions would conform.
