AGENDA ITEM 12

MATTERS RELATING TO THE APPOINTMENT OF OBSERVERS AT
CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS

OBSERVERS FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

1.    Article III paragraph 2 of the Antarctic Treaty states that:

     "..., every encouragement shall be given to the establishment of
     co-operative working relations with those Specialised Agencies of the
     United Nations and other international organizations having a
     scientific or technical interest in Antarctica."

2.    Such co-operative working relations have been established in the past
     with some international organizations such as WMO and FAO on an ad hoc
     basis and have lasted for as long as there has been a need for them.
     Apart, however, from the appointment of observers from SCAR and WMO
     for the Second Antarctic Treaty Meeting on Telecommunications,
     invitations have not been extended to international organizations to
     attend Antarctic Treaty meetings as observers.  It is timely to
     consider whether it might not now be appropriate to give further
     effect to Article III (2) of the Treaty by inviting appropriate
     organizations to be represented as observers where there is an item
     on the agenda related to their scientific or technical interests.
     Such observers would be invited to attend only those sessions of the
     meeting at which that item was being discussed.

3.    It would be a normal part of the task of the preparatory meeting for
     each consultative meeting to consider what, if any, agenda items
     warranted the issue by the host government of invitations to
     international organizations to be represented as an observer.

4.      There is a distinct but allied question which arises in connection
with international bodies to which the Treaty has itself given birth -
i.e., the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources.  It would seem to the U.K. appropriate that the Consultative
Parties should accord to the Commission normal observer status at all 
regular Consultative Meetings.
