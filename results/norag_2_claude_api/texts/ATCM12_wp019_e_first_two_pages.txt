The Representatives,

Understanding that a rational increase in scientific and
technical activities in Antarctica is of the utmost importance
if the aims of the Antarctic Treaty are to be fulfilled;

Noting with satisfaction the growing wish of the Contracting
Parties which are not Consultative Parties to increase their
respective Antarctic activities to this end;

Recognising that scientific activities in Antarctica are
extremely costly and that for this reason any unnecessary
duplication of effort on national and international Antarctic
research programmes should be avoided;

Taking into account that the fragile environment of Antarctica
and its dependent ecosystems, in order to be preserved, calls
for greater participation by the scientists and countries
interested in that region to promote a greater protection and
understanding of its nature;

Appreciating the desire of the Contracting States of the
Antarctic Treaty, in general, to participate actively in the
periodic meetings organised by SCAR and its Working Groups to
promote a greater scientific understanding of Antarctica;

Recalling that, through the intermediary of SCAR, the National
Committees of the Consultative Parties have made continual progress in
the coordination of the respective and combined efforts dedicated
to scientific and logistic investigations in Antarctica;

Considering that a greater number of contributions will also be
to the overall advantage of SCAR and of the Contracting
Parties;
