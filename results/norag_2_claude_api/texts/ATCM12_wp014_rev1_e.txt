Draft Recommendation

SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST - INTERIM GUIDELINES

The Representatives,

Recalling Article VI of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations
VII-3, VIII-3 and VIII-4;

Affirming that no Site of Special Scientific Interest shall be
designated in the marine environment other than in accordance
with the requirements of Recommendation VIII-3 and that no part
of the management plan for any such site may prejudice the
passage of vessels into, in or through the Site;

Noting that a management plan has been prepared for a Site of
Special Scientific Interest in part of South Bay, Doumer Island,
Palmer Archipelago and that the management plan has been
accepted by SCAR;

Considering that it would be advantageous to gather experience
of the practical effect of the management plan prepared for this
Site;

Recommend to their Governments that they voluntarily take
account of the management plan, annexed to this recommendation,
for Site No. 9 in part of South Bay, Doumer Island.

ANNEX

SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST NO. 9
SOUTH BAY, DOWNER ISLAND
PALMER ARCHIPELAGO
MANAGEMENT PLAN

(i)   Description of Site

The site consists of a small area of coastal and subtidal
benthos down to 45m depth as follows: Latitude 64o 51' 42" S. to
the North, between Longitudes 63o 34' 00" W and 63o 35' 20" W;
and to the South by a diagonal line that starts at a point 100
meters north of the Refuge on the southern shore of South Bay to
64o 51' 58" S, 63o 34' 00" W.  Boundaries are shown on the
attached map.

(ii)  Reason for Designation

This site is subject of a long-term research programme on
ecology and the purpose of designating it is, as far as
possible, to reduce the risk of accidental interference which
could jeopardize these scientific investigations.

(iii) Outline of Research

The study of the relationships among marine organisms
started by scuba diving in this area in 1972.  Since 1981
advanced type experiments to understand community structure and
functioning are under way, and will continue in the future.

These require the avoidance, as much as possible, of artificial interference.

(iv) Date of expiry of designation

June 1988

(v) Access points

There is no restriction on the passage of vessels into, in and through the Site.

(vi) Pedestrian and vehicular routes

Pedestrians and vehicles should, as far as is feasible, keep out of the Site.

(vii) Other kinds of scientific investigations which would not cause harmful interference

Any scientific research that requires collection of organisms should be avoided. Observations by scuba diving would not cause significant interference.

(viii) Scientific sampling

Collection of samples only for compelling scientific purposes.

(ix)   Other restraints

       The dumping of waste from ships and bottom trawling
should be avoided.  Anchoring should be avoided unless under
compelling circumstances.

Draft Paragraphs for Inclusion in the Final Report

7.           SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

A draft recommendation seeking the designation of a Site
of Special Scientific Interest in part of South Bay, Doumer 
Island, Palmer Archipelago was tabled by the delegations of
Chile, Argentina and the United Kingdom. The proposal by
Chilean scientists to designate this Site and the required
management plan had been previously approved by the SCAR Working
Groups on Biology and Logistics and by SCAR at its XVIIth
Meeting.

It was agreed that Sites of Special Scientific Interest
may only be designated in the marine environment if fully in 
accord with Recommendation VIII-3, especially operative
paragraphs 1(a) (i) and (ii) of that Recommendation and if no
restriction is placed on the passage of vessels into, in or
through the Site.

It was further agreed that, through national Antarctic
Committees, the attention of SCAR should be drawn to the
previous paragraph of this Report.
