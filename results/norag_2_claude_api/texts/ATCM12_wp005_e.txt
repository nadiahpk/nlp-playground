ITEM FIVE - TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND METEOROLOGY
(Draft recommendation submitted by Australia)


--- Scanned Page 2 ---

The Representatives;

Recalling Recommendation X-3;

Taking account of the importance of Antarctic meteorological
data to the World Weather Watch and the diminished value of 
such data if it is not available to users within and outside
the Antarctic in accordance with the World Meteorological
Organisation (WMO) schedules for the receipt of raw and
processed data;

Being aware of the problems leading to the non-arrival of
meteorological data on the GTS from time to time;

Noting, with appreciation, the efforts of the WMO Executive
Committee Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology and the
WMO Meeting on Antarctic Data Telecommunication Arrangements
toward improving the availability of Antarctic meteorological
data;

Recommend to their Governments that they:

1.          note the updated diagrams of meteorological data flow
within and from the Antarctic prepared by the WMO Meeting on
Antarctic Data Telecommunication Arrangements (see Annexes 1
and 2);

2.          note the following conclusions of the WMO Meeting on
Antarctic Data Telecommunication Arrangements:

·         the entry point (centre) on the GTS should be
responsible for the proper compiling and formatting of
the relevant Antarctic Bulletins, in accordance with 
established WMO telecommunication procedures;

· nations inject on the GTS only data from those
stations they are collecting, and submit the names of the
stations for inclusion in the WMO Catalogue of
Meteorological Bulletins;

· in applying the relevant WMO telecommunication
procedures WMO members should be urged to adhere strictly
to the procedures for the use of "NIL" and "RTD" as
prescribed in the Manual on the GTS, Volume I, Part II,
paragraphs 2.3.2.2 and 2.3.3.7;

· WMO members should carry out careful checking of the
contents of their switching directories to ensure that
Antarctic data bulletins are correctly handled;

· all WMO members concerned with the collection and
dissemination of Antarctic observational data are
requested to implement real-time monitoring of their
respective centres, in conformity with the provisions
included in the Manual on the GTS, Volume I, Attachment
I-5, Table C.
