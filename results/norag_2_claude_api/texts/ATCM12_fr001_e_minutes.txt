on the Agenda and appointed three working groups.  A working
group on Improvement of Telecommunications in Antarctica and
Collection and Distribution of Meteorological Data was chaired
by Dr J.S. Boyd of Australia.  A working group on Man's Impact
on the Antarctic Environment was chaired by Mr C.D. Beeby of New
Zealand.  A working group on the Operation of the Antarctic
Treaty System and Public Availability of the Documents of
Consultative Meetings was chaired by Mr R. Trolle Andersen of
Norway.

6.    The Meeting approved the following Recommendations which

--- New Agenda Item ---

Telecommunications  (Agenda Item 5)

7.         This Agenda item was discussed in Plenary and further
consultations were carried on in a Telecommunications Group
chaired by Dr John Boyd (Australia).  Copies of the SCAR Working
Group on Logistics "Antarctic Telecommunications Guidance
Manual" (SCARCOM) were circulated.  Appreciation was expressed
to SCAR and the Australian Antarctic Division for the
considerable work that had gone into the preparation of
SCARCOM.  It was accepted that the continuing usefulness of
SCARCOM depended on it being kept up to date.  The offer of the
Australian Antarctic Division to continue to maintain the manual
pending consideration by SCAR of its long term maintenance was
noted with appreciation.  Since the necessary information for
this purpose was in the hands of national Antarctic programs it
was considered appropriate that SCAR consult with them as to how
updating might best be achieved.

8.         Two points were considered in connection with the
adoption by some national Antarctic programs, since 1979, of
satellite communications.  First, it was suggested that national
Antarctic programs which had not adopted satellite
communications should be able to learn from the experience of
those that had.  Secondly, concern was expressed that the
widespread adoption of satellite communications by national
Antarctic programs might affect communications between
stations.  Attention was drawn to the increasing shipping and
aircraft activity in the Antarctic, to the need for point to
point communications to support such activity and to the need to
ensure that an adequate capability existed for communication
between stations to cope with emergency situations.  In order to
meet these concerns it was felt that a workshop could be the
best mechanism, possibly convened by SCAR in the context of a


--- Scanned Page 8 ---

5.

meeting of the SCAR Working Group on Logistics rather than as a
Meeting of Experts under the auspices of the Antarctic Treaty.
It was recognised that such a workshop could also provide an
opportunity to consider the matter of how best to ensure the
regular updating of SCARCOM.

9.     The reactivation of the WMO Executive Committee Working
Group on Antarctic Meteorology was warmly welcomed by all
Consultative Parties.  Appreciation was especially expressed for
the manner in which the Meeting on Antarctic Data
Telecommunication Arrangements had explored the difficulties
involved in ensuring that the inherent peculiarities of
Antarctic meteorological data could be adequately handled within
the Global Telecommunications System.  It was felt to be
appropriate that further work in this field, along lines already
identified in the Final Report of that meeting, should be
encouraged through the Permanent Representatives of Consultative
Parties with WMO.

10.     It was recognised that further work needed to be done on
the matter of requirements for raw and processed meteorological
data.  It was noted that while any national Antarctic program
should be able to state what data it wanted to receive, the
ability of stations from which data had been requested to
provide it would inevitably be subject to constraints.  It was
therefore felt that a revised statement of requirements should
reflect not only what data was wanted but also what could be
provided.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment  (Agenda Item 6)

11.     Draft Recommendations had been tabled by Argentina and
Chile about the connection between the Antarctic Treaty itself
and instruments derived from it, by Australia proposing
amendments to the Code of Conduct for Antarctic Expeditions and


--- Scanned Page 9 ---

Station Activities annexed to Recommendation VIII-11 and by the
United Kingdom calling for the adoption nationally, on an
experimental basis, of broadly defined procedures for the
assessment of the environmental impact of such activities of
national Antarctic expeditions which might have impacts which
were significant. In addition, Australia tabled a discussion
paper raising the question of whether there needed to be a
greater degree of coherence between measures for the protection
of the Antarctic environment adopted under the Antarctic Treaty
and instruments derived from the Treaty.

12. An Environmental Group was convened under the
chairmanship of Mr C.D. Beeby (New Zealand) which gave detailed
examination to all these proposals.

13. It was felt that, in a broad sense, the Argentine and
Chilean draft Recommendation and the Australian discussion paper
addressed similar concerns and should be treated together. In
debate, it was recognised that there was a need to consider
whether further co-ordination was necessary of the various
elements of environmental protection and conservation contained
in the Antarctic Treaty system.

14. Regarding the Australian draft recommendation on the Code
of Conduct it was agreed to refer to national Antarctic programs
the questions of problems in implementing the Code of Conduct
and of the desirability and feasibility of revising the Code of
Conduct (see Recommendation XII-4).

15. Regarding the United Kingdom's draft recommendation, it
was felt that the issues dealt with in the draft should be
referred to SCAR for advice. While it was noted that some
governments already subject their Antarctic programs to impact
assessment procedures, other Representatives felt that there was
a need to move cautiously in search of whatever element of
comparability it might be found prudent to apply, on a national
basis, to such procedures (see Recommendation XII-3).


--- Scanned Page 10 ---

7.

16. It was noted that the material set out in paragraphs 17
to 19 below, consisting of a description of the practice of a
number of countries in relation to environmental assessment
procedures, might be of value to SCAR in considering the issues
referred to it by Recommendation XII-3. It was further noted
that the Consultative Parties and National Committees of SCAR
might wish to forward to SCAR additional material relating to
their own procedures.

Environmental Impact Assessments

17. Among the steps found in some national environmental
impact assessment procedures are the following:

(i) definition of criteria to be used in determining whether
proposed activities have a significant impact on the
environment;

(ii) clear definition and description of the proposed
activity;

(iii) a first evaluation, performed by the organisation
responsible for the activity, of whether the proposal
might reasonably be expected to have a significant
impact;

(iv) if the result of such a preliminary evaluation is that
the proposed activity is likely to have no more than a
minor or transitory effect on the environment, the
activity would proceed;

(v) if the preliminary evaluation indicates that a proposed
activity is likely to have significant impacts on the
environment, an environmental assessment of the proposed
activity would be made;


--- Scanned Page 11 ---

8.

(vi)  such an assessment might be expected to include:

(a)  description of the proposed activity as well as
     feasible alternatives including the consequences
     of not proceeding;

(b)  description of the initial reference state with
     which predicted changes are to be compared and a
     prediction of future environmental states in the
     absence of action;

(c)  estimation of the nature and magnitudes of the
     likely environmental changes resulting from the
     proposed activity;

(d)  definition of the criteria to be used in
     measuring the significance of environmental
     changes, including the relative weighting to be
     assigned in comparing different kinds of changes;

(e)  estimation of the significance of the predicted
     changes;

(vii)  a decision would then be made on the basis of the
       assessment as to whether or not the activity should
       proceed in its original or a modified form, and this
       decision and the reasons for it would be notified to
       those interested or affected;  and

(viii) implementation of the accepted action.

18.  Monitoring of key indicators of the environmental effects
of such activities is an important element and may call for
modification of the activity.


--- Scanned Page 12 ---

9.

19. Where appropriate, the assessment procedures described above might also be expected to include the following steps:

(a) consideration of indirect or second order effects;

(b) consideration of the cumulative impacts of the proposed activity in the light of existing activities;

(c) description of any measures to be taken to maintain environmental quality; and

(d) description of the manner in which restoration of the environment would be achieved.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Sites of Special Scientific Interest (Agenda Item 7)

20. The Meeting considered a draft Recommendation by Chile, Argentina and the UK embodying a proposal for the designation of a Site of Special Scientific Interest at South Bay, Doumer Island in the Palmer Archipelago. The proposal and a management plan for the site has been considered and supported at the Seventeenth Meeting of SCAR. The site is partly terrestrial and partly marine.

21. It was agreed that any proposal for marine Sites of Special Scientific Interest should be carefully examined in the light of Article VI of the Antarctic Treaty and other factors.

22. The Meeting noted that the management plan, as amended, specified that the passage of vessels into, in and through the area would not be affected and that the restrictions placed on vessels (namely that bottom trawling, dumping of waste and anchoring should be avoided except in compelling circumstances) were of a limited kind.


--- Scanned Page 13 ---

10.

23.      The Meeting also noted, however, that at the Tenth
Consultative Meeting consideration of other Sites of Special
Scientific Interest in the marine environment (Chile Bay,
Greenwich Island and marine areas adjacent to SSSI No. 8,
Admiralty Bay, King George Island) had been deferred for future
consideration.  Noting that at previous meetings proposals for
such sites which included marine areas had not been approved, it
was agreed to defer the making of a decision at this meeting
pending further study.  It was therefore agreed that further
consideration of such SSSI's should be deferred until such time
as offices responsible for Antarctic programs had proposed to
SCAR, and SCAR had approved, SSSI's partly or wholly in the
marine environment.  In this context particular attention was
drawn to the criteria for the designation of any SSSI contained
in operative paragraphs 1(a)(i) and (ii) of Recommendation
VIII-3.

24.      Until such time as this matter might be considered at a
future Consultative Meeting or until June 1988, whichever came
earlier, it was agreed that offices responsible for Antarctic
programs operating in the vicinity of South Bay, Doumer Island
should be asked to draw the attention of their ship masters to
the scientific work proceeding in South Bay and to the draft
management plan reproduced at Annex B to this Report.

25.      It was noted that the designation of Site Numbers 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6 would expire on 30 June 1985;  that the
designation of Site No. 8 would expire on 31 March 1985, before
the probable date of the Thirteenth Consultative Meeting;  and
that the designation of Site No. 7 as a Site of Special
Scientific Interest expired on 30 June 1983.  The United States
Delegate circulated for information a message recently received
from the President of SCAR, Dr James Zumberge, stating that SCAR
had not yet reviewed whether such designations should be allowed
to lapse or should be extended, that such a review would be
conducted by SCAR and the results presented at the next


--- Scanned Page 14 ---

11.

Consultative Meeting, and that the Conservation Sub-Committee of
the SCAR Working Group on Biology requested the Consultative
Parties to extend the designation of these sites of Special
Scientific Interest until the next Consultative Meeting, when an
informal decision could be made. Accordingly, Recommendation
XII-5 extends the expiration date of the designations of Site
Numbers 1-8 until 31 December 1985, which would be after the
conclusion of the Thirteenth Consultative Meeting.

26. The Parties recognised that the designation of Site No. 7
had already expired and that Recommendation XII-5 might not be
formally approved and become effective, pursuant to Article IX-4
of the Treaty, until after the expiration dates of Site Numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8. Therefore, it was agreed that, in the
interim, the Parties would voluntarily observe the management
plans for these sites.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Tourism and non-Governmental Expeditions (Agenda Item 8)

27. The Meeting discussed the implications of the increase of
tourism and non-governmental expeditions in Antarctica. It was
agreed that the isolation of the region meant that assistance by
national programs to such activities was expensive, disruptive
to research programs and sometimes hazardous to life and
equipment.

28. The Meeting agreed that emergency assistance was a
humanitarian obligation, but that the risks and costs involving
other assistance in Antarctica might best be reduced by
Consultative Parties' urging upon private expeditions and tour
operators the need for careful and thorough planning and for
self-sufficiency in their operations. In accordance with
Article X of the Antarctic Treaty, the Meeting emphasized the
importance of ensuring that non-governmental expeditions to the
Antarctic Treaty area observed the principles and purposes of
the Antarctic Treaty and the relevant measures adopted under


--- Scanned Page 15 ---

12.

it. To this end it was agreed that Consultative Parties should
do their best to ensure that such expeditions were made aware of
these provisions. It also agreed that Consultative Parties
should keep each other fully informed about commercial or
private expeditions being planned in their countries.

29. It was noted that non-governmental expeditions and tour
operators should be covered by adequate insurance and by some
form of guarantee that would demonstrate their responsibility
for their activities. A view was also expressed that
responsibility for compliance by non-governmental expeditions
with the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations
adopted at the Consultative Meetings should be placed upon those
States whose physical or juridical persons organize such
expeditions or participate in them. Since there was no
agreement as to where responsibility for non-governmental
expeditions should lie, the draft Recommendation which had been
tabled was withdrawn.

30. It was agreed that the ideas expressed in the previous
paragraphs might be followed up and that further consideration
be given to them at the Thirteenth Consultative Meeting.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Activities of Countries not Party to the Antarctic Treaty
(Agenda Item 9)

31. There was a discussion of the inclusion, on the proposal
of Malaysia and Antigua and Barbuda, of an item on Antarctica on
the agenda for the 38th session of the United Nations General
Assembly. Consultative Parties unanimously reaffirmed their
commitment to the Antarctic Treaty and expressed their concern
that any attempts to modify or replace the Treaty would be
likely to introduce contention and instability into a region of
hitherto unparalleled peace and international co-operation.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Operation of the Antarctic Treaty System, and Public
Availability of the Documents of the Consultative Meetings
(Agenda Items 10 and 11)

32.     The delegation of Chile presented a systematic survey of
practical suggestions which - in time - might be considered by
the Consultative Parties in order to deal with the expanding
scope of international co-operation and interest in Antarctica.
There was general appreciation of the Chilean presentation,
which it was agreed could be considered also at the Thirteenth
Consultative Meeting.

33.     The inter-relationship between Agenda Item 10 and the
following Items 11, 12 and 13 was noted by several delegations.
However, for practical reasons, it was decided to convene a
Working Group under the chairmanship of Mr R. Trolle Andersen of
Norway for the consideration of Items 10 and 11 together.

34.     Consensus was reached on Recommendation XII-6 which
broadens the circulation of the Reports of regular Consultative
Meetings, as well as securing a continuous updating of, and the
inclusion of an explanatory introduction and prefaces in, the
"Handbook of Measures in Furtherance of the Principles and
Objectives of the Antarctic Treaty", renamed the "Handbook of
the Antarctic Treaty". In regard to the transmission of a copy
of the Final Report of the Meeting to the United Nations
Secretary-General, it was agreed that the question of whether he
be asked to circulate the report to member countries should be
left to the Consultative Parties' Missions in New York. In
addition, the Recommendation registers further progress with
regard to the public availability of documents. It also invites
the Depositary Government to examine the question of identifying
and cataloguing publicly available information about the
Antarctic Treaty System, and of the sources from which it may be
obtained.


--- Scanned Page 17 ---

14.

35.  The possibility of further disseminating general
knowledge of the Antarctic Treaty System through the future
elaboration of an extensive report - a White Book - on the
history and achievements of the Antarctic Treaty was discussed.
It was agreed that the matter would require further study, and
that it should be considered at the Thirteenth Consultative
Meeting.

36.  It was agreed that there was a practical need for the
host Government of a Consultative Meeting to continue to act as
co-ordinator for matters of common interest to the Consultative
Parties from the conclusion of one Consultative Meeting until
the Preparatory Meeting for the next. The Contracting Parties
expressed their appreciation to the Government of Australia for
its offer to accept this task until the next Preparatory Meeting
in 1985. It was agreed that the establishment of a more
permanent infrastructure to undertake these tasks would be
premature at the present time, but that the matter, together
with the question of frequency of meetings, should be discussed
further at the Thirteenth Consultative Meeting.

37.  It was agreed that "The Operation of the Antarctic Treaty
System" should be included on the Agenda of the Thirteenth
Consultative Meeting.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Observers (Agenda Item 12)

38.  Not all States which are Contracting Parties to the
Antarctic Treaty are entitled to appoint representatives to
participate in Consultative Meetings. Non-Consultative Parties,
like all Contracting Parties, have rights and obligations under
the Antarctic Treaty and are, as Parties, bound to carry out its
provisions and uphold its purposes and principles, and to
maintain and strengthen that Treaty. The Consultative Parties
therefore invited non-Consultative Parties to this Consultative


--- Scanned Page 18 ---

15.

Meeting and welcomed their attendance: it assisted the
deliberations of the Consultative Parties, helped to keep
non-Consultative Parties informed about activities under the
Treaty, and furthered the common aim of all Contracting Parties
to develop and strengthen the operation of the Antarctic Treaty
system.

39. For these reasons, the representatives of the
Consultative Parties endorsed the attendance of non-Consultative
Parties at the next regular Consultative Meeting. They
therefore decided to invite the non-Consultative Parties to the
Thirteenth Consultative Meeting, as well as to its Preparatory
Meeting. Draft Rules of Procedure incorporating the necessary
amendments were prepared by the Meeting, and will be referred to
Governments for their consideration on the clear understanding
that this would not affect the right of Special Consultative
Meetings, as Meetings held pursuant to Article IX of the
Antarctic Treaty, to adopt their own Rules of Procedure.
Consultative Parties which have not indicated their views by 1
April 1984 will be taken to have accepted the text. If any
government requests that the matter be discussed further, the
Australian Government will either pursue the matter through
diplomatic channels or will refer the draft Rules of Procedure
to the preparatory meeting for the Thirteenth Consultative
Meeting.

40. Since there was a close relationship between subjects to
be discussed at special Consultative Meetings and attendance at
those Meetings, the Meeting decided that the question of
attendance at future Special Consultative Meetings could be
decided only when such Meetings were being convened. As regards
the Fourth Special Consultative Meeting, the Meeting took note
of the wish of several of the non-Consultative Parties that they
should be invited to attend future sessions. The Meeting was of
the view that attendance at the Fourth Special Consultative
Meeting, representation at which had been determined in 1981,
was a matter to be decided by that Meeting.


--- Scanned Page 19 ---

16.

41.     A statement by Non-Consultative Parties is at Annex C.

42.     There was a full discussion of the extent to which, in
the light of paragraph 2 of Article III of the Antarctic Treaty,
the attendance of appropriate international organisations at
regular Consultative Meetings might assist the Consultative
Parties.  The Meeting concluded that, as part of the preparation
for each regular Consultative Meeting, the Consultative Parties
should consider whether the Consultative Parties would be
assisted in their discussion of any item of the agenda of the
regular Consultative Meeting if a Specialised Agency of the
United Nations or other international organisation having a
scientific or technical interest in Antarctica were to attend
the Meeting as an observer when that item was being discussed;
and, if so, whether the relevant organisation should, with the
agreement of all Consultative Parties, be invited by the host
government to attend the Meeting on that basis.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Exchanges of Information Under the Antarctic Treaty
(Agenda Item 13)

43.     The meeting discussed a proposal that it might be
opportune to review the timeliness of exchanges of information
under Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty, by seeking
the views of those directly responsible for Antarctic programs,
as the bodies which both provided the major part of the
information and should also gain most from its timely exchange.
It was suggested that the first step in such a review required
that Consultative Parties' offices responsible for their
Antarctic programs should be asked for advice as to:

        (i)     the date by which they would ideally wish to
                receive exchanged information;


--- Scanned Page 20 ---

17.

(ii) whether each of them could assemble that part of
the information for which they were responsible
one month before the date identified under the
preceding sub-paragraph to allow time for
transmission of the information through
diplomatic channels;

(iii) whether the exchange of information called for
under Recommendation II-VI (Annex to
Recommendation VIII-6, para 2) should be combined
with the exchanges called for under paragraph 1
of the Annex to Recommendation VIII-6;

(iv) whether some of the information called for in the
Annex to Recommendation VIII-6 might better be
exchanged after, rather than before, the activity
in question; and

(v) whether, as one means of more effectively
implementing Article III.1(c) of the Treaty,
brief reports on the implementation of scientific
investigations might be included in the
information exchanged.

It was also suggested that national contact points might be
designated to which enquiries about activities, scientific
observations and results could be addressed.

44. The Meeting agreed that, after advice on these questions
had been received from offices responsible for national
Antarctic programs, the matter should be discussed at the
Thirteenth Consultative Meeting. In the meantime, the Meeting
agreed that it would be useful to encourage the maximum of early
informal information exchange between offices responsible for
national Antarctic programs.


--- Scanned Page 21 ---

18.

45.      The Meeting also exchanged views on whether it might be
desirable to give special attention to information exchanged,
under Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty, about
activities on geophysical research in which the techniques used
might be indistinguishable from those activities which would
take place in the early stages of exploration for off-shore
hydrocarbon resources.  A number of Delegations noted that
Article III of the Antarctic Treaty established obligations to
exchange and make freely available scientific observations and
results from Antarctica.  In this regard, the United States
Delegation made available its plan for data release of
geophysical research to be undertaken in January/February 1984
by the Research Vessel "Lee", which would include the depositing
of record sections and magnetic tapes of seismic and other data
in the US National Data Centre, where copies would be freely
available, subject to payment of reasonable reproduction costs.
A map showing the proposed cruise track would also be available
before the cruise began, as well as the actual cruise track
after the cruise had taken place.

46.      The Japanese Delegation informed the Meeting that all
scientific data produced by Japan, including those from recent
expeditions by the "Hakurei Maru", would be freely available on
request to their Government.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Uses of Antarctic Ice  (Agenda Item 14)

47.      The Meeting took note of two technical information papers
on the potential uses of ice, and agreed to discuss the issue
again at the Thirteenth Consultative Meeting.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Antarctic Minerals  (Agenda Item 15)

48.      This was a procedural item only.  A report on the
progress of negotiations towards a regime to regulate Antarctic
minerals exploration and exploitation was given by Dr E.F. Jung

of the Federal Republic of Germany, Chairman of the Second
Session of the Fourth Special Consultative Meeting on Antarctic
Mineral Resources. The Meeting noted that these negotiations
were taking place in another forum, welcomed the progress in the
negotiations that had taken place so far, and expressed the hope
for an early completion of negotiations.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Date and Place of Next Consultative Meeting (Agenda Item 16)

49. The Meeting welcomed the Belgian Delegation's indication
that Belgium was in principle willing to host the Thirteenth
Consultative Meeting in 1985, subject to final confirmation as
early as possible.

--- New Agenda Item ---

Any Other Business (Agenda Item 17)

50. The Meeting agreed that Consultative Parties, being not
all members of the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), should not respond
collectively to Resolution 15/20 adopted in 1982 by the IUCN.

51. The Meeting adopted Recommendation XII-7, establishing
the site of the temporary Indian station "Dakshin Gangotri" as a
Historic Monument, to be annexed to Recommendation VII-9, as
Monument No. 44.

52. The Meeting agreed to send the traditional telegram of
greetings to all Antarctic stations. The text of the message is
at Annex D.

53. On a number of occasions in the course of the Meeting
attention was drawn to the financial implications for SCAR of
the requests for advice being put to SCAR through National
Committees for consideration. In this context Recommendation
XII-8 was adopted.


--- Scanned Page 23 ---

20.

54.  Attention was also drawn to the needs of those
Contracting Parties which were not Consultative Parties but
which might wish to undertake scientific investigations in the
Antarctic. It was noted that the main sources of advice were
offices responsible for national Antarctic programs and SCAR.
Representatives of Consultative Parties affirmed the willingness
of their national Antarctic programs to respond to requests for
advice. It was noted that the constitution of SCAR provided for
national and observer status within SCAR, and that those
Contracting Parties which had recently become Consultative
Parties had gained much from attending SCAR meetings. States
interested in learning more about SCAR should address their
enquiries to the Executive Secretary, Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research, Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge,
CB2 1ER, United Kingdom.

55.  The United States delegation circulated for information
to all Delegations a copy of the report of an inspection tour of
Antarctic stations which was undertaken in the summer of
1982/83, in accordance with Article VII.3 of the Antarctic
Treaty.
