The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations VIII-3, VIII-4 and X-6;

Noting that, pursuant to Recommendation X-6, the designation as
Sites of Special Scientific Interest of the Sites numbered 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6 will expire on 30 June 1985, and the designation
of Site No. 8 will expire on 31 March 1985, before the probable
date of the Thirteenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting,
and that the designation of Site No. 7 expired on 30 June 1983;

Desirous that the designation of these sites as Sites of Special
Scientific Interest not be allowed to expire before the
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) has reviewed
the Sites and presented the results of its review to the
Consultative Parties;

Noting the intention of SCAR to review all Sites of Special
Scientific Interest at the XVIII meeting of SCAR in 1984 and to
present the results of its comprehensive review to the
Consultative Parties for consideration at the 13th Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting in 1985.

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. The date of expiry of the following sites should be
extended from 30 June 1985 to 31 December 1985:

Agenda Item 7

It was noted that the designations of Site Numbers 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6 would expire on 30 June 1985, and that the
designation of Site No. 8 would expire on 31 March 1985, before
the probable date of the Thirteenth Consultative Meeting and
that the designation of Site No. 7 as a Site of Special
Scientific Interest expired on 30 June 1983. The United States
delegate circulated for information a message from the President
of SCAR, Dr James Zumberge, stating that SCAR had not yet
reviewed whether such designations should be allowed to lapse or
should be extended, that such a review would be conducted by
SCAR and the results presented at the next Consultative Meeting,
and that the Conservation Sub-Committee of the SCAR Working
Group on Biology requested the Consultative Parties to extend
the designation of these Sites of Special Scientific Interest
until the next Consultative Meeting, when an informed decision
could be made. Accordingly, Recommendation XII- extends the
expiration date of the designation of Site Numbers 1-8 until 31
December 1985, which would be after the conclusion of the
Thirteenth Consultative Meeting.

The Parties recognised that the designation of Site No. 7
had already expired and that Recommendation XII- might not be
formally approved and become effective, pursuant to Article 9
(4) of the Treaty, until after the expiration dates of Site
Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8. Therefore, it was agreed that,
in the interim, the Parties would voluntarily observe the
management plans for these sites.
