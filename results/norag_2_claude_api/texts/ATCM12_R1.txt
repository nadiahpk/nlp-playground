XII-1

THE COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC
METEOROLOGICAL DATA

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendation VI-3 and X-3;

Noting Resolutions 4,5,6,7 and 8 of the WMO Executive Committee,
Thirty Fourth Session June 1982 concerning meteorological
observing networks, collection and transmission of
meteorological data and meteorological data processing in
Antarctica;

Recognising

(1)   the continuing importance of Antarctic meteorological
      data for support of operations within Antarctica and for
      weather forecasting and research, especially climate
      research in the rest of the world;

(2)   the need to maintain a basic network of meteorological
      stations providing surface and upper-air synoptic data to
      meet in so far as possible the requirements of
      Consultative Parties and of the WMO World Weather Watch;

(3)   the diminished value of meteorological data if it is not
      available to users within and outside the Antarctic in
      accordance with the WMO schedules for the receipt of raw
      and processed data;

23.

(4)    the paucity of Antarctic meteorological surface and upper
       air data and the consequent importance of maintaining
       regularity of meteorological observations;  and

(5)    that the increasing shipping and aircraft activities in
       Antarctica will give rise to increasing demands for
       meteorological support;

Reaffirming  the importance of the WMO Global Telecommunications 
System (GTS) for purposes of transmitting Antarctic
meteorological data between Antarctic stations in cases where
direct transmission within Antarctica is inhibited by
ionospheric conditions, and noting that the adoption by some
Consultative Parties of satellite communications may facilitate 
the reception within Antarctica of meteorological data from the 
GTS;

Noting:

(1) that monitoring carried out by WMO in 1982 and 1983 on
    the flow of Antarctic meteorological data into the GTS
    indicates that significant deficiencies remain;

(2) the reactivation of the WMO Executive Committee Working
    Group on Antarctic Meteorology and the outcome of its
    Third Session in April 1982, including preliminary work
    on a review of the requirements for raw and processed
    data set out in Annexes 1 and 2 of Recommendation VI-3;

(3) the efforts of the WMO Meeting of Experts on Antarctic
    Data Telecommunication Arrangements in June 1983, in
    reviewing and updating the meteorological
    telecommunications routing diagrams set forth in Annexes
    1, 2 and 3 of Recommendation X-3;  and

24.

(4)    that the aforesaid WMO Meeting of Experts arrived at a
       number of conclusions and recommendations aimed at
       improving Antarctic telecommunications for meteorological
       purposes, and at improving the manner in which Antarctic
       meteorological data is transmitted within the GTS of the
       WMO World Weather Watch;

Recognising the need to keep under review:

(1)    the requirements for raw and processed Antarctic
       meteorological data; and

(2)    the arrangements for transmission of meteorological data
       within Antarctica and between Antarctica and the WMO
       World Weather Watch system;

Recommend to their Governments that they:

(1)    use their best endeavours, subject to any overriding
       scientific, administrative or budgetary considerations,
       to secure full implementation of the network of stations
       and observational programs set forth in Annex 1 of this
       Recommendation;

(2)    maintain and improve, subject to any overriding
       scientific, administrative or budgetary considerations,
       the system for collection and distribution of
       meteorological data to, from and within Antarctica having
       regard to the routing arrangements shown in Annexes 2 and
       3, which are based on the conclusions of the WMO Meeting
       of Experts on Antarctic Data Telecommunication
       Arrangements in June 1985;


--- Scanned Page 5 ---

25.

(3) seek, through their Permanent Representatives with WMO,
the completion of Annex IV to the Final Report of the
aforesaid WMO Meeting of Experts, as a helpful
contribution to planning the exchange of available
meteorological data;

(4) seek, through their Permanent Representatives with WMO,
to ensure that consideration is given, as appropriate, to
other conclusions and recommendations made by the
aforesaid WMO Meeting of Experts;

(5) invite WMO through their Permanent Representatives with
that Organisation, to keep under review the arrangements
for routing of meteorological data within Antarctica and
between Antarctica and the GTS of the World Weather
Watch, and to suggest actions which might be taken to
improve the timely receipt of data at stations in
Antarctica and at World Meteorological Centres Melbourne,
Moscow and Washington and other centres in the World
Weather Watch System, having particular regard to
changing requirements for meteorological information and
to opportunities offered by new technology; and

(6) note that the statements of requirements for raw and
processed Antarctic meteorological data provided by the
WMO pursuant to Recommendation X-3 paragraph 9 require
refinement, and invite WMO, through their Permanent
Representatives with that Organization, to undertake such
refinement.
