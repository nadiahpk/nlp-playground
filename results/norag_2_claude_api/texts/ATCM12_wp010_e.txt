     submitted by the United Kingdom)

[Explanatory Note:  This matter was discussed at length in the course of the
XIth ATCM.  No conclusion was reached.  It was agreed that the matter should
be the subject of further consultation at the XIIth ATCM.  It may help
colleagues in considering this matter if some of the main points made in the 
discussion at Buenos Aires are recalled:

(a)   a distinction could be drawn between those documents of Consultative
Meetings that are publicly available and those that are not;

(b)   reports of Consultative Meetings are already publicly available;

(c)   the practice of Consultative Meetings hitherto has been that these
Reports of Consultative Meetings contain:

(i)       the Recommendations adopted at the Consultative Meeting;

(ii)      a report of the outcome of the discussion of each agenda
item setting the associated Recommendation in context, or
briefly describing the scope of the discussion if no
Recommendation had been made;

(iii)     any papers of the Consultative Meeting which the Consultative
parties had agreed should be annexed so as adequately to
describe and report the results of the Meeting;

(iv)      a statement by the Depositary Government relating to the
approval of Recommendations;   and

(v)       statements delivered by Heads of Delegation at the public
opening session of the Meeting;

(d)   these Reports should at least be no less informative than those
reporting recent Consultative Meetings;

(e)   some Consultative Parties were required by their constitutional

procedures to publish the Recommendations of Consultative Meetings;

(f) Recommendation VIII-8 requires that states likely to become
Consultative Parties, be urged to approve Recommendations that had
already become effective;

(g) reports of Consultative Meetings should be sent by the host
government of each Meeting to Contracting Parties that had not
become Consultative Parties;

(h) at the discretion of the Consultative Parties the attention of a
specialized agency of the United Nations or an international
organisation having a scientific or technical interest in
Antarctica could be drawn to the Report of a Consultative Meeting,
either in whole or in part, in fulfilment of Article III,
paragraph 2, of the Treaty;

(i) the "Handbook of Measures in furtherance of the Principles and
objectives of the Antarctic Treaty" should be kept up to date and
each language edition should contain the same material;

(j) while it was felt that the working documents of Consultative
Meetings should, as is the practice at present, not be publicly
available at the close of Consultative Meetings; nevertheless,

(k) some delegations believed that some papers submitted by them could
be made publicly available if that was the understanding on which
they had been submitted; while

(l) other delegations believed that public access to any paper of a
Consultative Meeting (other than those contained in the Report of
the Consultative Meeting) depended on there being a consensus that
it should be made accessible;

2

(m) the status of papers to which the public already had access through
other arrangements could not be altered by their submission to a
Consultative Meeting;

(n) some delegations favoured the introduction of two series of
Consultative Meeting documents (other than the Reports of
Consultative Meetings), one being open to the public and the
other closed;

(o) other delegations believed that such a distinction could inhibit
the negotiating process;

(p) there could be advantage in making arrangements by which the
working documents of Consultative Meeting could be made available
to interested members of the public after a period of, say, five
years after the closing date of the Consultative Meeting for which
they were prepared.

The United Kingdom delegation believes there is a pressing need to
take action to increase the public availability of the working documents of
the Consultative Meetings, to broaden the circulation of the Reports of
Consultative Meetings and to maintain the Treaty Handbook. The following
draft Recommendation reflects sub-paragraphs (g), (h), (i) and (p) above.]

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION
ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS FOR CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that:

1. In addition to sending Consultative Parties certified copies of the
Report of Consultative Meetings as called for in Recommendation I-XIV,
paragraph 1, the Government of the host country of each Consultative Meeting
shall also send copies of the Report of that meeting to all other
Contracting Parties;

2. In furtherance of Article III, paragraph 2, of the Treaty, the Government of the host country, as and when the Representatives of Consultative Parties consider it appropriate, may be requested to draw the attention of any Specialized Agency of the United Nations or any other international organization to any part of the Report of the Consultative Meeting relevant to the scientific or technical interest which the agency or organization might have in Antarctica;

3. The "Handbook of Measures in Furtherance of the Principles and Objectives of the Antarctic Treaty" should be available in an up to date form and should contain the same material in each language edition;

4. The Working Documents of those Consultative Meetings that took place more than five years before the date on which this Recommendation becomes effective in accordance with Article IX, paragraph 4, of the Treaty may be made publicly available. Thereafter, the Working Documents of each Consultative Meeting may be made publicly available five years after the closing date of the Meeting for which they were prepared.
