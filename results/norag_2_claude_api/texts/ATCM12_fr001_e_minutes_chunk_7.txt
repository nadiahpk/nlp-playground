Exchanges of Information Under the Antarctic Treaty
(Agenda Item 13)

43.     The meeting discussed a proposal that it might be
opportune to review the timeliness of exchanges of information
under Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty, by seeking
the views of those directly responsible for Antarctic programs,
as the bodies which both provided the major part of the
information and should also gain most from its timely exchange.
It was suggested that the first step in such a review required
that Consultative Parties' offices responsible for their
Antarctic programs should be asked for advice as to:

        (i)     the date by which they would ideally wish to
                receive exchanged information;

17.

(ii) whether each of them could assemble that part of
the information for which they were responsible
one month before the date identified under the
preceding sub-paragraph to allow time for
transmission of the information through
diplomatic channels;

(iii) whether the exchange of information called for
under Recommendation II-VI (Annex to
Recommendation VIII-6, para 2) should be combined
with the exchanges called for under paragraph 1
of the Annex to Recommendation VIII-6;

(iv) whether some of the information called for in the
Annex to Recommendation VIII-6 might better be
exchanged after, rather than before, the activity
in question; and

(v) whether, as one means of more effectively
implementing Article III.1(c) of the Treaty,
brief reports on the implementation of scientific
investigations might be included in the
information exchanged.

It was also suggested that national contact points might be
designated to which enquiries about activities, scientific
observations and results could be addressed.

44. The Meeting agreed that, after advice on these questions
had been received from offices responsible for national
Antarctic programs, the matter should be discussed at the
Thirteenth Consultative Meeting. In the meantime, the Meeting
agreed that it would be useful to encourage the maximum of early
informal information exchange between offices responsible for
national Antarctic programs.

45.      The Meeting also exchanged views on whether it might be
desirable to give special attention to information exchanged,
under Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty, about
activities on geophysical research in which the techniques used
might be indistinguishable from those activities which would
take place in the early stages of exploration for off-shore
hydrocarbon resources.  A number of Delegations noted that
Article III of the Antarctic Treaty established obligations to
exchange and make freely available scientific observations and
results from Antarctica.  In this regard, the United States
Delegation made available its plan for data release of
geophysical research to be undertaken in January/February 1984
by the Research Vessel "Lee", which would include the depositing
of record sections and magnetic tapes of seismic and other data
in the US National Data Centre, where copies would be freely
available, subject to payment of reasonable reproduction costs.
A map showing the proposed cruise track would also be available
before the cruise began, as well as the actual cruise track
after the cruise had taken place.

46.      The Japanese Delegation informed the Meeting that all
scientific data produced by Japan, including those from recent
expeditions by the "Hakurei Maru", would be freely available on
request to their Government.
