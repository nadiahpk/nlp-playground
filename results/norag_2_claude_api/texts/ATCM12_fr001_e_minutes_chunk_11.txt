54.  Attention was also drawn to the needs of those
Contracting Parties which were not Consultative Parties but
which might wish to undertake scientific investigations in the
Antarctic. It was noted that the main sources of advice were
offices responsible for national Antarctic programs and SCAR.
Representatives of Consultative Parties affirmed the willingness
of their national Antarctic programs to respond to requests for
advice. It was noted that the constitution of SCAR provided for
national and observer status within SCAR, and that those
Contracting Parties which had recently become Consultative
Parties had gained much from attending SCAR meetings. States
interested in learning more about SCAR should address their
enquiries to the Executive Secretary, Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research, Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge,
CB2 1ER, United Kingdom.

55.  The United States delegation circulated for information
to all Delegations a copy of the report of an inspection tour of
Antarctic stations which was undertaken in the summer of
1982/83, in accordance with Article VII.3 of the Antarctic
Treaty.
