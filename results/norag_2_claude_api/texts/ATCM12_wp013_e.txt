   (Explanatory Note and Draft Recommendation
        submitted by the United Kingdom)

[ Explanatory Note: This matter was discussed at length in the course of
the XIth ATCM. No conclusion was reached and the reasons are set out in
the Final Report of that meeting. It was agreed that the subject should
be further considered at the XIIth ATCM. It may help colleagues in
considering this matter if some of the main points made in the discussion
at Buenos Aires are recalled:

(a) information exchanged about planned activities (Articles III,
1(a) and VIII (5) should be as precise and accurate as possible;

(b) information about planned activities should be exchanged in time
"to permit maximum economy and efficiency of operations" (Article
III, 1(a)) as between Antarctic programmes;

(c) information is not being exchanged in time to be of maximum use
to offices administering Antarctic programmes and to those in the
Antarctic who needed it;

(d) Antarctic operations are now beginning earlier after the winter
than had been the normal practice when the date by which information
was to be exchanged was established;

(e) the exchanges of information under Article VII (5) of the Antarctic
Treaty bear an important relation to the inspection provisions of
the same Article;

(f) without in any way replacing the obligation under Article III
1(a) of the Antarctic Treaty, it would be helpful if brief reports
on the implementation of scientific investigations could be provided;

(g) it would help to reduce the burden of information exchanges if the
information called for under Recommendation IV-27 relating to
modifications in the previous years plans could be exchanged at the
same time as information about the following season's plans;

(h)  it would be useful if national contact points were designated  to
     which enquiries about activities could be addressed;

(i)  a difference of opinion existed between those who considered that
     the date by which information is to be exchanged should be brought
     forward in order to ensure its maximum usefulness and those who
     considered that the further that date is brought forward the more
     inaccurate information about plans would become and that this
     inaccuracy could counter balance the advantages of an earlier
     exchange date.

     The United Kingdom considers that it would be useful to have the
views on these matters of those directly responsible for Antarctic programmes
and of SCAR through National Antarctic Committees, thus seeking the opinion
of those who both provide the major part of the information and should gain
most from its timely exchange.  A recommendation drafted with that end in
view follows.)

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION
EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION UNDER THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

The Representatives,
     Recalling that the exchange of information called for under
Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty and twenty subsequent
Recommendations of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings were consolidated
into a "Standard format for the annual Exchanges of Information" annexed
to Recommendation VIII-6;
     Recognising that the date for the primary exchange of information
has remained at 30 November each year since 1961 and that the Antarctic
operations of many Consultative parties now begin earlier than that date
each year;
     Noting that the SCAR Working Group on Logistics, meeting on the
occasion of the XVIIth meeting of SCAR, agreed to exchange certain
information in advance of the formal exchange of information under

Article VII (5) of the Antarctic Treaty;

Recalling that under Recommendation II-VI any extensions,
reductions or other modifications of activities previously reported are
to be furnished before 30 June each year; and

Recognising that, while the exchanges of information should be as
useful as possible to those operations in Antarctica, the accuracy of such
exchanges needs to be ensured since they perform an important function in
relation to the inspections provided for under Article VII of the Antarctic
Treaty;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.     A review of the timeliness of exchanges of information is now
opportune;

2.     That the first step in such a review requires that their offices
responsible for their Antarctic programmes should be asked for
advice as to:

(i)   the date by which they would ideally wish to receive exchanged
information;

(ii)  whether each of them could assemble that part of the information
for which they are responsible one month before the date identified
under the preceding sub-paragraph to allow time for transmission
of the information through the diplomatic channel;

(iii)  whether the exchange of information called for under Recommendation
II-VI (Annex to Recommendation VIII-6, para 2) should be combined
with the exchanges called for under paragraph 1 of the Annex to
Recommendation VIII-6;

(iv)  whether some of the information called for in the Annex to
Recommendation VIII-6 might better be exchanged after, rather than
before, the activity in question;

(v)   whether, as one means of more effectively implementing Article
     III-1(c) of the Treaty, brief reports on the implementation of
     scientific investigations might be included in the information
     exchanged;

(vi)  national contact points might be designated to which enquiries
     about activities, scientific observations and results could be
     addressed.

3.       They be ready to consider this matter further at the Thirteenth
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
