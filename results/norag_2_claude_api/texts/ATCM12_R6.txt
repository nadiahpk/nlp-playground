The Representatives,

Noting that the Antarctic Treaty, based on principles of the
United Nations Charter, in the interest of all mankind,
establishes Antarctica as an area dedicated exclusively to
peaceful purposes, to international harmony and to international
scientific cooperation;

Noting further that the Antarctic Treaty, the numerous measures
adopted in furtherance of the principles and objectives of the
Treaty and other instruments and acts associated with it
constitute a far-sighted and effective system of international
co-operation, which promotes international peace and security,
increase in scientific knowledge and understanding, and
effective environmental protection;

Desiring to involve the Contracting Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty which are not Consultative Parties more closely with the
Antarctic Treaty System;

Conscious of the value of increasing public knowledge of the
achievements and operation of the Antarctic Treaty System;

Recalling Article III, paragraph 2 of the Antarctic Treaty which
encourages co-operative working relations with those Specialised
Agencies of the United Nations and international organisations
having a scientific and technical interest in Antarctica;
