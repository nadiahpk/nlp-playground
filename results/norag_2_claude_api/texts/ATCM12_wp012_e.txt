              ITEM 13:  EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION

               (Note submitted by the United Kingdom)

The United Kingdom has noted that activities are proceeding in
Antarctica which involve some or all of seismic reflection surveys,
depth soundings, sub-bottom profiling, sono-radio buoy refraction surveys,
magnetometer surveys, gravimetric surveys, measurements of terrestrial
heat flow and bottom sampling aboard research vessels. Certain doubts
have arisen in the mind of the United Kingdom as to whether such activities
fall within the scope of operative paragraph 8 of Recommendation IX-1.
While recognising and welcoming the information already provided about
these activities in conformity with the Antarctic Treaty, these doubts
have arisen from a recognition that although such activities are entirely
consistent with purely scientific objectives they are also indistinguishable
from those activities that would take place in the early stages of explora-
tion for offshore hydrocarbon resources.

In these circumstances it is the view of the United Kingdom that
pending the timely adoption of agreed solutions pertaining to exploration
and exploitation of mineral resources, a Government whose activities might
reasonably be expected to give rise to a doubt of the nature described
above needs to give special attention to the fulfilment of its obligations
under Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty.

In this context the United Kingdom wishes to invite the views of
its Consultative partners as to whether, in such cases, it would be
reasonable for the governments of Consultative Parties to accept that in
relation to such maritime research activities:

(i) the announcement of such planned activities under Article VII of
the Treaty should be accompanied by a proposed track chart;

(ii) within a reasonable time after the completion of the voyage:

(a) a track chart should be made available showing what
observations were taken and where;

(b) the ship's log-book should be open for inspection;

(c) the data should be open for inspection; and that

(iii) copies of published papers deriving from the voyage should be
sent to the Governments of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties.

In suggesting that data should be open for inspection the United
Kingdom recognises that it would need to be understood that neither the
ownership of the data nor the owners' copyright was to be prejudiced.

The United Kingdom is aware that such a practice set out in the
preceding paragraph, if it were effectively to set at rest the sort of
doubt previously described, ought to be based on the same principle of
reciprocity that underlies Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty.
