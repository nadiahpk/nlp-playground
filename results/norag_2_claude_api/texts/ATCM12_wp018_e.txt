        ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT
(Submitted by the Environment Working Group)

THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

The Representatives,

Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty, Recommendations
VI-4, VIII-11, VIII-13 and IX-5;

Noting that in these Recommendations, which have become
effective in accordance with Article IX, Paragraph 4 of the
Antarctic Treaty, certain principles were elaborated and
adopted, namely that:

(i)     the ecosystem of the Antarctic Treaty Area is vulnerable
        to human interference;

(ii)    the Antarctic derives much of its scientific importance
        from its uncontaminated and relatively undisturbed
        condition;

(iii)   in considering measures for the wise use and protection
        of the Antarctic environment their Governments shall act
        in accordance with their responsibility for ensuring that
        such measures are consistent with the interests of all
        mankind;

(iv)    no act or activity having an inherent tendency to modify
        the environment over wide areas within the Antarctic
        Treaty Area should be undertaken unless appropriate steps
        have been taken to foresee the probable modifications and
        to exercise appropriate controls with respect to the
        harmful effects such uses of the Antarctic Treaty Area

may have;

Recalling that in accordance with these principles there has
been established for the Antarctic a substantial series of
measures for the protection, conservation and wise use of
Antarctic fauna and flora consisting of the Agreed Measures for
the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, the Convention
for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals and the Convention on
the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources;

Noting that the States involved in Antarctic research activities
are in the best position to assess potential environmental
impacts of such activities and to develop assessment procedures
which might, with benefit, be applied to determining whether the
activities they plan to conduct are likely to have significant
impacts;

Considering that a measure of comparability between such
procedures might, in the future, become desirable;

Affirming that environmental assessment procedures should not
prejudice one of the fundamental principles of the Antarctic
Treaty providing for freedom of scientific investigation as set
out in Article 2 of the Antarctic Treaty and that such
procedures should not encroach upon nor prejudice provisions for
the protection of the environment and the conservation of living
resources contained in instruments that have been or may, in the
future, be negotiated as parts of the Antarctic Treaty system;
.
Recommend to their Governments that:

1.      In relation to any scientific activity they plan to
conduct, including the planned provision of logistic facilities
to support such activity, they urge their respective national
organizations responsible for Antarctic activities to continue
to scrutinize the plans for such research and logistic
activities, in accordance with procedures they have developed or
may develop, to determine whether the planned activities are
likely to have significant impacts;

2.      If a preliminary determination indicates that a planned
research or logistic activity could have potentially significant
impacts on the environment, their relevant agencies undertake a
detailed environmental assessment in accordance with procedures
they have developed or may develop, with a view to determining
the factors likely to cause such impacts and, if the seriousness
of such impacts so indicates, to elaborating feasible research
and logistic alternatives aimed at minimizing harmful effects on
the environment.  In the event that such an assessment is
completed they notify other Consultative Parties;

3.      Through their National Committees, they invite the
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to:

        (i)      offer scientific advice regarding the definition
                 of categories of research and logistic activity
                 in Antarctica which might reasonably be expected
                 to have a significant impact on the environment;

        (ii)     offer, bearing in mind, inter alia, the
                 discussion at this Meeting as reflected in
                 paragraphs   to   of its Report, such advice as
                 seems to SCAR to be relevant to the elaboration
                 of assessment

procedures which may be applied by the relevant
agencies of the Consultative Parties, on an
experimental basis, with regard to research and
logistic activity;

4.       The question of Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment
should be considered further at the next Consultative Meeting.
