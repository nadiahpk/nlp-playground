MESSAGE FROM THE TWELFTH CONSULTATIVE MEETING TO
STATIONS IN ANTARCTICA
(Submitted by the Secretariat)


--- Scanned Page 2 ---

Representatives of the Sixteen Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Parties have just completed two weeks of discussion
at the Twelfth Consultative Meeting, held in Canberra and hosted
by the Government of Australia.

Two new Consultative Parties, Brazil and India, were
accepted at a Special Consultative Meeting held in Canberra
before the opening of the Twelfth Consultative Meeting.

Throughout their deliberations, the representatives of
the Consultative Parties were mindful that the successful
operation of the Antarctic Treaty depended in large part on the
continuation of the tradition of peaceful international
scientific co-operation established during the International
Geophysical Year. The addition of two new Consultative Parties
should serve to strengthen scientific co-operation in
Antarctica.

As the Antarctic winter draws to a close, all delegations
participating in the Twelfth Consultative Meeting extend warmest
congratulations to you who, under the most arduous circumstances
have contributed to advancing our objectives in Antarctica, and
they extend best wishes for a successful summer to all those
preparing to go south.
