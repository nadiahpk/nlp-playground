The Representatives,

Recalling:        Article II of the Antarctic Treaty,
                  Recommendations VI-4, VIII-11, VIII-13, IX-5 and
                  XI-1;

Noting:

      that in these Recommendations, which have become
      effective in accordance with Article IX, Paragraph 4 of
      the Antarctic Treaty, certain principles were elaborated
      and adopted, namely that:

      (i)        the ecosystem of the Antarctic Treaty Area is
                 vulnerable to human interference;

      (ii)       the Antarctic derives much of its scientific
                 importance from its uncontaminated and relatively
                 undisturbed condition;

      (iii)      in considering measures for the wise use and
                 protection of the Antarctic environment their
                 Governments shall act in accordance with their
                 responsibility for ensuring that such measures
                 are consistent with the interests of all mankind;

      (iv)       no act or activity having an inherent tendency to
                 modify the environment over wide areas within the
                 Antarctic Treaty Area should be undertaken unless
                 appropriate steps have been taken to foresee the
                 probable modifications and to exercise
                 appropriate controls with respect to the harmful
                 effects such uses of the Antarctic Treaty Area
                 may have;

1.


--- Scanned Page 3 ---

Recalling:

   that in accordance with these principles there has
been established for the Antarctic a substantial
series of measures for the protection, conservation
and wise use of Antarctic fauna and flora consisting
of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of
Antarctic Fauna and Flora, the Convention for the
Conservation of Antarctic Seals and the Convention
on  the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources;

Noting:

   that the exploration and exploitation of Antarctic
minerals would give rise to risks of environmental
damage on a scale hitherto unknown in the Antarctic
and that their Governments are committed to the
development within an Antarctic minerals regime of
measures to assess the environmental impact of such
activities and to the elaboration of measures aimed
at reducing the impact of such activities to a minimum.

Recognising:

   that the activities of their Governments in Antarctica
in pursuit of knowledge are not themselves generally
subject to prior scrutiny of their potential
environmental effects, and that if new procedures were
to be adopted they should not prejudice one of the
fundamental principles of the Antarctic Treaty
providing for freedom of scientific investigation;

2.


--- Scanned Page 4 ---

Recognising:

that the evolution of the present system of
Recommendations and conventions has paralleled the
increasing level and complexity of man's activities
in Antarctica;

Being Aware:

that future developments in Antarctica will call for
further measures for the protection of the environment.

Recalling:

that the development of the principles and procedures
for environmental impact assessment has been the subject
of detailed international study and elaboration by the
Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment
(SCOPE) of the International Council of Scientific
Unions;

Recognising:

however, that any activity in the Antarctic has some
impact, whether of a transitory or more permanent
nature; that it is only in relation to such activities
as are likely to have an environmentally significant
impact that codified assessment procedures might, with
benefit, be applied and that the question of the sort
of activity which would give rise to "significant
impact" ought to be the subject of further study and
refinement leading to clear definition;

Desiring:

that the totality of measures for the protection of
the Antarctic environment should form a coherent
whole;

Recommend:

to their governments that:

1.    They give consideration to the ways in which a
     coherent system of measures for the protection
     of the Antarctic environment might be developed.

2.    In order to assist in the development of such
     measures (including measures for the prediction
     of environmental impacts and the application of
     appropriate controls with respect to the possible
     harmful effects of activities in Antarctica), in
     relation to any proposed activity in pursuit of
     the scientific objectives of the Antarctic Treaty
     (including the proposed provision of logistic
     facilities to support such activity) that might
     reasonably be expected to have more than a
     transitory or minor impact on the Antarctic
     environment, they voluntarily adopt, for
     experimental purposes and in order to gain
     practical experience. the Interim Guideline
     Procedures set out below:
     
     (i)     The proposed activity should be clearly
             described and defined;

4.


--- Scanned Page 6 ---

(ii)    A first evaluation of whether the
        proposal might reasonably be expected to
        have more than a transitory and minor
        impact on the environment should be made,
        preferably making use of an appropriately
        qualified independent reviewer or advisory
        group to examine the statement of the
        proposed activity.  If the result of such
        an examination is a judgement that the
        proposed action will not significantly
        affect the environment, it should then
        proceed, although its effects should be
        monitored against the conclusions in the
        assessor's report;

(iii)   If the proposed activity is believed to
        have potentially significant impacts on
        the environment, an environmental
        assessment of the proposed activity and
        feasible alternatives should be made.
        Such an assessment should:

        (a)  describe the proposed activity as
             well as feasible alternatives
             including the consequences of not
             proceeding;

        (b)  describe the initial reference
             state with which predicted changes
             are to be compared and predict future
             environmental states in the absence
             of action;

5.


--- Scanned Page 7 ---

(c) estimate the nature and magnitudes
    of the likely environmental changes
    resulting from the proposed
    activity;

(d) define the criteria to be used in
    measuring the significance of
    environmental change, including the
    relative weighting to be assigned
    in comparing different kinds of
    changes;

(e) estimate the significance of the
    predicted changes, i.e. estimate the
    acceptability of the proposed
    activity;

(f) give consideration to the indirect
    impacts which the activity might
    have;

(g) give consideration to the cumulative
    impacts of the proposed action and
    other existing and proposed actions;

(h) describe the manner in which
    restoration of the environment
    would be achieved (if appropriate);

(i) describe the safeguards and standards
    to be followed in the conduct of the
    proposed action or the operation of
    the proposed facility;

6.


--- Scanned Page 8 ---

(iv)    A decision should be made on the basis
        of the assessment as to whether:
        
        -     the action should proceed in the
              proposed form and under appropriate
              conditions;
        
        -     the action should proceed in a
              modified form and under appropriate
              conditions;  or
        
        -     the action should not proceed

              and the conclusions and reasons for
              reaching them should be stated in a
              report.
        
(v)     Implementation of the accepted action
        should be described;

(vi)    Monitoring of key indicators of the
        environmental effects of implementation
        and comparison of the changes taking
        place against the assessment predictions
        should be carried out.

3.      At each future Consultative Meeting Consultative
        Parties should table for the information of 
        their partners papers relating to any action
        taken in accordance with the previous paragraph.

4.      They invite the Scientific Committee on
        Antarctic Research (SCAR), through their
        National Committees:

7.


--- Scanned Page 9 ---

(i)    to consider the categories of activity
       in Antarctica related to the pursuit of
       the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty
       (excluding resource related activities)
       which might reasonably be expected to
       have a "significant impact" on the
       environment;

(ii)   to consult with SCOFE as may seem
       desirable on the procedures for the
       assessment of environmental impact;  and

(iii)  to offer through their National Committees
       such advice as seems to SCAR to be
       relevant to the future consideration by
       Consultative Parties of agreed measures
       for the protection of the Antarctic
       environment that might be adopted under
       the Antarctic Treaty.

5.     In the light of experience gained and of SCAR's
       advice, they consider at a future Consultative
       Meeting the formulation and adoption of agreed
       Measures for the Protection of the Antarctic 
       Environment.
