The Representatives,

Taking into account Recommendation XII relating to the
strengthening of ties between SCAR and the National Committees
of the Contracting Parties which are not Consultative Parties
to the Antarctic Treaty;

Considering that the Contracting Parties which are not Consultative
Parties are clearly interested in participating more actively
in the scientific and technological activities in Antarctica;

Stating that SCAR is the non-governmental organisation that
coordinates [all] national and international scientific and
technical programmes related to Antarctic research;

Believing that a greater number of contributions would be
advantageous to SCAR;

Recommend to their Governments that:

They ask SCAR, through their respective National Committees,
to intensify its exchange of scientific information with the
National Committees of the Contracting Parties which are not
Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, to ensure an
[active, growing] effective and progressive participation of
their scientists in scientific and technological research
activities in Antarctica in order to avoid an unnecessary
duplication of effort, and that they ask SCAR to take all
precautions to ensure that those Contracting Parties which are
not Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty are allowed
sufficient participation through their respective National
Committees in the XVIII Meeting of SCAR, to be held in the
Federal Republic of Germany on                  1984.
