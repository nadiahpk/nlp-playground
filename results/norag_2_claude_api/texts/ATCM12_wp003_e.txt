IMPROVEMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN ANTARCTICA AND
DISTRIBUTION OF METEOROLOGICAL
DATA


(Explanatory note and Draft Recommendation submitted
by the United Kingdom)


--- Scanned Page 2 ---

EXPLANATORY NOTE
1.         The arrangement of adequate telecommunications to enable
meteorological data to be exchanged between Antarctic stations has been
among the more pressing concerns of national Antarctic programmes since
the International Geophysical Year. Three Antarctic Treaty Meetings on
Telecommunications have been held in Washington (1963), Buenos Aires
(1969) and Washington (1978).

2.         Underlying the discussions at these meetings has been the
difficulty of trans-auroral belt transmissions. The auroral belt in
high southern latitudes is so disposed that some Antarctic stations lie
within it and some outside it. Those stations within it have difficulty
in establishing satisfactory communications with those outside it or
with the outside world; those stations outside it can communicate
adequately with the outside world but not with stations inside it. A
satisfactory solution to this problem has, until recently, eluded the
technical specialists. A solution which is now beginning to emerge is
that meteorological data could be transmitted out of Antarctica via
south to north satellite links, could be circulated through the Global
Telecommunications System (GTS) of the WMO World Weather Watch (WWW),
and should be relayed back to Antarctica via north to south satellite
links to those Antarctic stations that require them for forecasting
purposes. If such an arrangement could be made to work, and there is
no physical reason why it should not, the advantages would include:
(a) improved reliability;
(b) reduced manpower requirements at Antarctic stations, and
(c) timely receipt of Antarctic meteorological data at
meteorological centres in the WWW that need them for forecasting
purposes.

3.         Such an arrangement should, in principle, work entirely
automatically from the point where encoded meteorological data is fed
into a satellite communications link, to the numerous points where they
can be made available for forecasting purposes. However, not all

Antarctic stations are yet equipped to enable them to use satellite
communications and there are a number of technical problems to be
solved both at Antarctic stations and within the ONS.

4.    At the Tenth Consultative Meeting a Recommendation was
adopted that foresaw the possibility of a solution to the technical problem
of Antarctic telecommunications for meteorological purposes along the
lines set out in paragraph 2 above. Since then the WMO Executive
Committee Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology held its Third Session
in Geneva from 5-8 April 1982 and a further Meeting on Antarctic Data
Telecommunication Arrangements was held in Geneva from 20-22 June 1983.
The results of these meetings, more especially of the latter one, mark
a significant advance on the way towards a cost effective solution to
Antarctic meteorological telecommunications problems. Following the
pattern established at earlier Consultative Meetings of marking such
advances by means of a Recommendation (III-V, VI-1 to 3, VII-7 and
X-3) a Draft Recommendation is attached.

IMPROVEMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN ANTARCTICA
FOR METEOROLOGICAL PURPOSES

(Draft Recommendation submitted by the United
Kingdom)

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendation X-3;

Noting that at a WMO Meeting on Antarctic Data Telecommunication
Arrangements held in Geneva from 20 to 22 June 1983, the opportunity was taken
to review and revise Annexes 1, 2 and 3 to Recommendation X-3, taking
into account changes in the network up to June 1983 (see Annexes 1 and
2);

Noting further that this Meeting arrived at a number of conclusions
aimed at improving Antarctic telecommunications for meteorological
purposes and at improving the manner in which Antarctic meteorological
data is transmitted within the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) of
the WMO World Weather Watch (WWW);

Recognising, however, that Antarctic telecommunications arrangements
adopted by each national Antarctic programme are devised so as to meet
other operational requirements as well as the need for transmission of
Antarctic meteorological data;

Recommend to their Governments that:
1.       Taking account of the Final Report of the Meeting on Antarctic
Data Telecommunication Arrangements (Geneva, 20-22 June 1983), they
should strive to improve the operation of the system for the collection
and transmission of Antarctic meteorological data to the GTS;

2.       Through their Permanent Representatives to the World

Meteorological Organisation, they should seek to improve the
transmission of Antarctic meteorological data within the GTS and to
ensure that stations in the Antarctic which need Antarctic
meteorological data and meteorological data from neighbouring areas
should be able to receive them from the GTS on a real-time basis;

3.         Through their Permanent Representatives to WMO, they should
provide information to the Secretary-General to enable the table at
Annex IV to the Final Report of the Meeting on Antarctic Data
Telecommunication Arrangements, entitled "Requested data exchange
between collecting centres in the Antarctic and appropriate WMC's,
RTH's or NMC's", to be completed.
