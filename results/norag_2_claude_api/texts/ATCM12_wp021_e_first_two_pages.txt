The Representatives,

Recalling paragraph 2 of Article III of the Antarctic Treaty

Acknowledging that the attendance of appropriate international
organisations at Consultative Meetings as observers during the
discussion of particular items on the agenda of the Meeting may
assist the consideration of those items by the Consultative
Parties;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.      As part of the preparation for each Consultative Meeting
they decide, with the agreement of all Consultative Parties -

(a) whether the Consultative Parties would be assisted in
their discussion of any item on the agenda of the
Consultative Meeting if an international organisation having
a scientific or technical interest in Antarctica were to
attend the Meeting as an observer when that item was being
discussed, and

(b) if so, which international organisation the host
government should invite on that basis.

2.      The host government of each regular Consultative Meeting
should invite the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic
Marine Living Resources to attend that Meeting as an observer.
