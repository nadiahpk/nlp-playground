The Representatives,

Recognising that the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research
(SCAR) of the International Council of Scientific Unions
comprises a unique assemblage of knowledge and expertise in
Antarctic scientific fields;

Noting with appreciation the advice provided to the Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Parties by SCAR in response to various
requests;

Being aware that under its Constitution SCAR is charged with
"furthering the co-ordination of scientific activity in
Antarctica, with a view to framing a scientific program of
circumpolar scope and significance";

Being aware also that the assistance requested of SCAR by the
Consultative Parties imposes additional demands on scarce
resources;

Recommend to their Governments:

That they consider in the light of its expertise and past
assistance any requests that may be made by their national
committees for additional funding to meet costs to SCAR of
responding to requests for advice by the Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Parties.
