         ITEM 10. OPERATION OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY  
(Working Document presented by the Delegation of Chile)


--- Scanned Page 2 ---

The Delegation of Chile requested that the above item be discussed
at the XII ordinary Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, to be held in
Canberra from 13 to 27 September, 1983.

At the XI Consultative Meeting held in Buenos Aires, the Delegation 
of Chile presented document ANT/XI/5/Rev.1, dated 6 July 1981, (attached to
this document as Annexure 1) concerning this subject which was discussed
at the said Meeting. On 13 December, 1982, the Government of Chile addressed
a note to the Australian Government, officially requesting the inclusion of
this item and enclosed the explanatory Memorandum, which is attached as
Annexure 2.

During an informal meeting held in Wellington, New Zealand, in
January this year, the inclusion of this item was also discussed in an
introductory and informal manner.

In brief, its aim is to examine the operation of the System
evolved under the present Antarctic Treaty, bearing in mind its evolution
since its adoption, as well as global development during the same period,
and the growing interest shown in all Antarctic issues. The intention is
not to modify the fundamental mechanisms of the Antarctic Treaty or the
Antarctic Treaty System in general but rather to consider the practical
measures which could be implemented by the Consultative Parties to bring
it into line with present-day developments.

The Antarctic Treaty has been one of the most efficient and far-sighted
instruments conceived in this century within the sphere of international
co-operation. The entry into force of this instrument resulted in the
creation of an area which for the first time in contemporary history
embodied the principles of peace, demilitarisation and denuclearisation;
it created the first large scientific laboratory and ecological reserve
within the different areas of the planet; it established, within the
framework of the United Nations and with the full participation of its

1

members, international co-operation among states of all latitudes and
continents, a measure of development and political systems; and, in general,
it permitted the acquisition of knowledge, protection, connection and
communication of the Antarctic continent with the rest of the world.

The adoption of a Group of Recommendations by the Consultative
Parties of the Antarctic Treaty has adequately complemented the Treaty by
covering the following: a fuller understanding of the continent, the
protection of its ecosystem, development of land, sea air and telegraphic
communications within the Antarctic area and with the rest of the world,
meteorology, tourism and, in general, all those elements which constitute
the administration of Antarctica in the name of and to the benefit of
mankind. The legal acts elaborated by the same parties to the Treaty in
the continent itself and which have promoted a fuller understanding, as
well as greater protection and improved communications with the rest of the
world, have enforced the said measures. In addition, the Consultative
Parties have created Conventions for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals
and of Marine Living Resources in general, and have agreed to abstain from
mineral resource activities while they complete the preparation of a regime
to cover the utilization of these resources, while fully respecting the
Antarctic ecology. All that - the Antarctic Treaty, its Recommendations,
legal acts in the Antarctic itself and the complementary instruments - ,
constitute what has been appropriately called the Antarctic System.

This System really is a sub-system integrated into the general
international system. The Antarctic Treaty provides a framework for the
principles and objectives of the United Nations charter; is open to
Accession by its members and establishes a basis for total co-operation
between the bodies forming the Organization. During the twenty years
it has been in force, it has been tacitly accepted by the rest of the
International Community, which has sometimes also referred to it
explicitly, as was the case at the 1975 FAO Meeting, where the competence
of the Treaty with regard to the Antarctic ecosystem was recognised. In
addition, explicit reference has been made to it in various international

2

statements, among which it is worth mentioning the statement made by the
United Nations Secretary General himself. The authenticity of the
Antarctic Treaty and of the System that it has created, as well as the
service that it has rendered and must continue to render mankind as a
whole, cannot, therefore, be questioned.

However, the evolution of the Antarctic Treaty and of its System,
of the Antarctic situation itself and of world politics, together with the
growing special interest shown with regard to Antarctic resources compel
us to envisage steps to keep abreast of this evolution, without modifying
the Treaty itself, which has shown its adequacy and sufficiency in
complying with its objectives.

In this respect, it would be appropriate to consider three areas
fundamental to the evolution of the System:

1. The internal efficiency and co-ordination of the Antarctic System;
2. A greater and better exposure of the System and its achievements; and
3. A better relationship with third party States, international bodies
and organizations interested in the Antarctic in general.

With regard to the internal efficiency and co-ordination of the system,
of prime consideration is the status of those parties of the Antarctic Treaty
which are not Consultative Parties. A greater participation and closer
co-ordination of their activities should be sought. Furthermore, it would
be convenient to consider, within the context of internal organization,
mechanisms for co-ordination between the Treaty itself and the instruments
resulting from it.

With regard to universal exposure of the system, it is obvious that
there is a need for a better circulation of its recommendations, proceedings
and achievements, in response to the interest shown by States, international

3


--- Scanned Page 5 ---

bodies and academic institutions; an interest which has even come to light
recently in the domain of international politics.

Finally, better ways of developing ties between the System itself and
other States, with international organizations competent within the fram-
work of its activity, and with general international opinion, should be
considered.

The proposed adaptation would probably imply the need to establish
a basic infrastructure of co-ordination. The necessity and form of this
infrastructure should be the object of careful analysis.

In relation to all and each of these items, the Delegation of Chile
considers it appropriate to propose various options or possibilities for the
development and adaptation of the Antarctic System. They will be described
below in a tentative and preliminary manner with the purpose of giving rise
to an in-depth discussion among the Consultative Parties to bring about
necessary consensus.

MEASURES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE OPERATION OF THE ANTARCTIC SYSTEM

It is necessary to examine the co-ordination of the various
elements of the System, the exposure of its activities, its representation
before the international community, its practical relationship with other
international systems, the participation of other entities, etc.

Without claiming to exhaust the subject, it is recommended that
decisions to act in the following areas be taken:

1.    Distribution and circulation of achievements obtained through the
      application of the Antarctic Treaty.

The following measures could be considered:

1.a)    Preparation of a report that includes all agreements and
        work carried out under the Antarctic Treaty during the 22
        years since its entry into force, to be published wholly or
        partially according to consensus.

1.b)    Regular preparation of a report which could be made public,
        based on the Final Report of the Consultative Meetings.

1.c)    Publication of major projects and scientific studies, with
        which such countries and organizations that are interested in
        some Antarctic issues, are acquainted.

1.d)    Publication of the Reports and Recommendations of the
        Consultative Meetings and other documentation that the
        Consultative Parties judge suitable for disclosure, based on
        the 'Handbook of Measures'.

1.e)    Delivery of an annual information document to the U.N.
        Secretary General, duly authorized by the Consultative

1


--- Scanned Page 7 ---

Parties and distributed by them as a document of the
Organization, about the activities of the Antarctic System.

1.f)     Exposure of the Antarctic Treaty to the United Nations'
members and of the benefits that may be enjoyed by the
countries that have joined it.

2.      Participation of those Members of the Antarctic Treaty who are not
Consultative Parties:

The following rights would be offered to non-consultative members
of the Antarctic Treaty:

2.a)     Reception of the Final Report and the Recommendations
adopted in each Consultative Meeting.

2.b)     Access to the scientific information which the Consultative
Parties consider appropriate.

2.c)     Participation, as observers, in ordinary Consultative
Meetings.

2.d)     The right to general information and consultation regarding
the Special Consultative Meetings.

2.e)     Reception of the information exchanged pursuant to Article
III (1) of the Antarctic Treaty.

2.f)     Facilities for the participation of national scientists
of Treaty members in the regular Antarctic activities of the
Consultative Parties.

2

3.  Relationship with the Organizations of the United Nations and other
    International or Regional Organizations:

    3.a)     To continue rendering assistance to the Scientific Committee
             for Antarctic Research (SCAR) and to the co-operative process
             to which it belongs.

    3.b)     To invite observers from specific organizations to those
             Antarctic meetings in which the Consultative Parties
             consider their participation useful and appropriate.

    3.c)     To study joint progress with a view to carrying out
             investigations and studies on matters of common interest,
             within the objectives and principles of the Antarctic 
             Treaty.

    3.d)     The consultative countries being responsible for the
             observance of the Antarctic Treaty provision in the area,
             should  study the scientific research programmes which the
             afore-mentioned organizations wish to undertake in Antarctica.

    3.e)     Organisation of periodic meetings for exchanges of information,
             consultations and co-ordination at a technical level with
             the interested organizations, as determined by the
             Consultative Parties, within the general context of
             co-operation with each of them in their respective sphere
             of competence.

4.  Contacts with other Entities related to Antarctica:

    There are international, regional and national, non-governmental and
    private entities which, according to their objectives, carry out
    specific activities directly or indirectly related to the Antarctic
    Continent, in areas such as tourism, telecommunications, meteorology,

3


--- Scanned Page 9 ---

transportation, scientific research, education, ecological conser-
vation, utilization of living resources, etc.

In order to acquire a greater control over and a wider knowledge of
these activities and in order to guarantee that the principles,
objectives and provisions of the Antarctic Treaty System are respected,
it is recommended that a working relationship with the headquarters
of such entities be established where circumstances make it advisable.

This would, at the same time, facilitate the implementation of the
important task of exposing the Antarctic Treaty System.

5.  Representation of the Antarctic Treaty System:

Within the context of Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty, and in
order to produce a wider international acceptance of the Antarctic
Treaty System, the following actions are recommended:

5.a)    Participation of a representative of this System at meetings
        of the United Nations Organizations and other international
        or regional organizations, as an observer, where circumstances
        make it advisable.

5.b)    Organisation of periodic contracts for the exchange of
        information, co-ordination and consultation between the
        representative of this System and the Secretary General of the
        United Nations and other appropriate organizations as
        determined by the Consultative Parties.

5.c)    Description of the Antarctic Treaty System to interested
        States.

6.  Exchange of Information between the Contracting Parties

The exchange of information carried out pursuant to Article III (1)
of the Antarctic Treaty is representative of the principle of
international co-operation which is the basis of the System created
by this instrument.  International co-operation is, in itself, a
fundamental element of the external image projected by the System.
Consequently, it is recommended that certain specific aspects of the
afore-mentioned exchange of information be improved in order to
stress its importance as a means of international co-operation.

To this effect the following measures are proposed:

6.a)   To bring forward the dates on which reports are to be
       circulated;

6.b)   To give the contents of such reports in greater detail;

6.c)   To extend their circulation as determined by the Consultative
       Parties;

6.d)   To organize their distribution in the most efficient and
       appropriate manner.

7.   Administrative Aspects

The improvement of the operative mechanisms of the Antarctic Treaty
System requires several measures of an administrative nature.

The following are recommended:

7.a)   To add to the 'Handbook in Furtherance of the Principles and
       Objectives of the Antarctic Treaty', starting from its last
       edition, United States 1979, after each Consultative Meeting.

7.b) The maintenance of a data bank containing all the information
produced by the Antarctic Treaty System.

7.c) To store and classify the documents from the Consultative
Meetings.

7.d) Co-ordination, exchange of information and consultation with
those bodies established within the context of the Antarctic
Treaty System.

7.e) Maintaining liaison between consecutive Consultative Meetings.

7.f) Co-ordination of the Consultative Parties between Consultative
Meetings.

7.g) Carrying out work before Consultative Meetings.

8. Infrastructure required for the Implementation of the Proposed Actions

The activities derived from the Antarctic Treaty System and the actions
recommended to bring its mechanisms into line with its present state
of internal development and with the international situation in which
it is evolving, makes it necessary to equip this System with a certain
infrastructure to undertake the tasks of expansion, liaison,
representation, co-ordination, organisation and documentation mentioned
above.

To this effect, three options are submitted:

8.a) The creation of a Centre to assume all the recommended
responsibilities. This would imply a considerable infra-
structure, probably one of a high cost; or

8.b) The creation of a Secretariat 'pro tempore', located success-
ively in the host countries where the previous Consultative

6


--- Scanned Page 12 ---

Meetings were held,and directed by its respective Chairman, also under the status of 'pro-tempore', to undertake all the tasks mentioned above. This would probably not compensate satisfactorily the existing anomalies; or

8.c) The adoption of a mixed System on the basis of the following guidelines:

(i) The creation of a small permanent office, subordinated to the Consultative Parties, which would undertake those tasks requiring greater continuity, in particular those related to circulation (1-a; 1-c; 1-d; 1-f; 1-g; 1-h; 1-i; 1-j); tasks relating to the participation of other entities in the Treaty and the representation of the Treaty in other forums (2-b; 2-d; 3-b; 3-d; 4); tasks relating to the exchange of information between the Consultative Parties (6-c; 6-d); and several tasks of an administrative nature (7-a; 7-b; 7-c; 7-d; 7-f);

(ii) The adoption of a system of a 'pro-tempore' secretariat, according to the mechanism described under (8-b) above. This organization would assume those activities not requiring such continuity and would also be subordinated to the Consultative Parties, in particular those activities related to the circulation (1-b; 1-e); to liaison and representation work closely connected to the Consultative Meetings (2-a; 2-c; 3-a; 3-c; 5-a; 5-b; 5-c); and to certain administrative aspects (7-e; 7-g).
