Draft Recommendation

SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST - INTERIM GUIDELINES

The Representatives,

Recalling Article VI of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations
VII-3, VIII-3 and VIII-4;

Affirming that no Site of Special Scientific Interest shall be
designated in the marine environment other than in accordance
with the requirements of Recommendation VIII-3 and that no part
of the management plan for any such site may prejudice the
passage of vessels into, in or through the Site;

Noting that a management plan has been prepared for a Site of
Special Scientific Interest in part of South Bay, Doumer Island,
Palmer Archipelago and that the management plan has been
accepted by SCAR;

Considering that it would be advantageous to gather experience
of the practical effect of the management plan prepared for this
Site;

Recommend to their Governments that they voluntarily take
account of the management plan, annexed to this recommendation,
for Site No. 9 in part of South Bay, Doumer Island.
