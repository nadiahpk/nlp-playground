ITEM 5:  DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON ANTARCTIC
         TELECOMMUNICATIONS

(Submitted to Plenary by the Telecommunications Working Group)

[Antarctic Treaty emblem figure]

ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations VI-1, VII-7 and X-3;

Recognising that Antarctic telecommunications are designed to
carry operational, scientific and meteorological traffic and
that improvement of the telecommunications system would serve to
ensure timely and full exchange of information;

Recognising that recent developments in the use of satellites,
of which some Consultative Parties have made use, have improved
the reliability of communication links between Antarctic
stations and the outside world, but that consequent diminished
reliance on conventional telecommunication methods may have
affected the capability of stations to communicate with each
other;

Noting with appreciation, the response of the SCAR Working Group
on Logistics to the request in Recommendation X-3, paragraph 6,
to prepare an Antarctic Telecommunications Guidance Manual
(SCARCOM);

Noting that the increasing shipping and aircraft activity in
Antarctica will require improved telecommunications and
meteorological support by Consultative Parties undertaking such
increased activity;

Recommend to their Governments that:

(1)    They strive to ensure effective use of the Antarctic
      telecommunication systems already in existence, and to
      utilise as appropriate the developing satellite
      communication systems with a view to achieving improved
      communications between the Antarctic stations, as well as
      between those stations and points outside Antarctica;

(2)    They invite SCAR, through their National Antarctic
      Committees, to:

      (i)    consider, in consultation with agencies
             responsible for national Antarctic programs
             (hereinafter referred to as "national Antarctic
             programs"), how best SCARCOM can be periodically
             updated so that it may provide adequate guidance
             to telecommunications operators on
             telecommunication practices of national Antarctic
             programs and relevant internationally agreed
             procedures;

      (ii)   examine issues relating to increased use of
             satellite communications including:

             (a)  an exchange of information and experience
                  arising out of the adoption of satellite
                  communications for the benefit of those
                  national Antarctic programs which have not
                  adopted this means of telecommunication;

(b) the cost-effectiveness of satellite
    communications and the benefits to
    operational efficiency and scientific
    research that may by derived therefrom;

(c) identification of any problems which may be
    encountered in communication between the
    stations of different national Antarctic
    programs in the event of more widespread
    adoption of satellite communications;

(d) exploration of means by which any such
    problems might be overcome while maintaining
    the cost-effectiveness and other benefits of
    satellite communications;

(iii)    examine the adequacy of the Antarctic
         telecommunications system to meet demands arising
         from the expansion of shipping and aircraft
         activity in Antarctica, and to suggest
         improvements where these might be desirable. In
         this examination particular attention should be
         given to:

         (a) communications between Antarctic stations;

         (b) use of the existing facilities for
             communications between Antarctica and the
             outside world;

(c)  communications between stations, ships and
     aircraft for the purpose of co-ordinating
     emergency and search and rescue operations.
