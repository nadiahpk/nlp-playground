MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

The Representatives,

Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty, Recommendations
VI-4, VIII-11, VIII-13 and IX-5;

Noting that in these Recommendations, which have become
effective in accordance with Article IX, Paragraph 4 of the
Antarctic Treaty, certain principles were elaborated and
adopted, namely that:

(i)   the ecosystem of the Antarctic Treaty Area is vulnerable
      to human interference;

(ii)  the Antarctic derives much of its scientific importance
      from its uncontaminated and relatively undisturbed
      condition;

(iii) in considering measures for the wise use and protection
      of the Antarctic environment their Governments shall act
      in accordance with their responsibility for ensuring that
      such measures are consistent with the interests of all
      mankind;  and

(iv)  no act or activity having an inherent tendency to modify
      the environment over wide areas within the Antarctic
      Treaty Area should be undertaken unless appropriate steps
      have been taken to foresee the probable modifications and

to exercise appropriate controls with respect to the
harmful effects such uses of the Antarctic Treaty Area
may have;

Recalling that in accordance with these principles there has
been established for the Antarctic a substantial series of
measures for the protection, conservation and wise use of
Antarctic fauna and flora consisting of the Agreed Measures for
the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, the Convention
for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals and the Convention on
the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources;

Noting that the States involved in Antarctic research activities
are in the best position to assess potential environmental
impacts of such activities and to develop assessment procedures
which might, with benefit, be applied to determining whether the
activities they plan to conduct are likely to have significant
impacts;

Considering that a measure of comparability between such
procedures might, in the future, become desirable;

Affirming that environmental assessment procedures should not
prejudice one of the fundamental principles of the Antarctic
Treaty providing for freedom of scientific investigation as set
out in Article II of the Antarctic Treaty and that such
procedures should not encroach upon nor prejudice provisions for
the protection of the environment and the conservation of living
resources contained in instruments that have been or may, in the
future, be negotiated as parts of the Antarctic Treaty system;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.     in relation to any scientific activity they plan to
       conduct, including the planned provision of logistic
       facilities to support such activity, they urge their
       respective national organizations responsible for
       Antarctic activities to continue to scrutinize the plans
       for such research and logistic activities, in accordance
       with procedures they have developed or may develop, to
       determine whether the planned activities are likely to
       have significant impacts;

2.     if a preliminary determination indicates that a planned
       research or logistic activity could have potentially
       significant impacts on the environment, their relevant
       agencies undertake a detailed environmental assessment,
       in accordance with procedures they have developed or may
       develop, with a view to determining the factors likely to
       cause such impacts and, if the seriousness of such
       impacts so indicates, to elaborating feasible research
       and logistic alternatives aimed at minimizing harmful
       effects on the environment.  In the event that such an
       assessment is completed they notify other Consultative
       Parties;

3.     through their National Committees, they invite the
       Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to
       offer:

       (i)     scientific advice regarding the definition of
               categories of research and logistic activity in
               Antarctica which might reasonably be expected to
               have a significant impact on the environment;
               and

(ii) bearing in mind, inter alia, the discussion at
this Meeting as reflected in paragraphs 17 to 19
of its Report, such advice as seems to SCAR to be
relevant to the elaboration of assessment
procedures which may be applied by the relevant
agencies of the Consultative Parties, on an
experimental basis, with regard to research and
logistic activity; and

4. the question of Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment
should be considered further at the next Consultative
Meeting.
