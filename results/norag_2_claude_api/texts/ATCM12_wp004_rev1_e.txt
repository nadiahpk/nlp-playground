DRAFT RECOMMENDATION
Submitted by the United Kingdom

Non-Governmental Expeditions

The Representatives,

Recalling  Recommendations I-X, IV-27, VI-7, VIII-9 and X-8 and
the provisions in these Recommendations applicable to
non-governmental expeditions;

Recognizing  that requests for assistance from such expeditions 
may be categorized as follows:

(a) assistance at the planning stage ("planned" assistance);

(b) assistance provided in the Antarctic to remedy 
deficiencies ("necessary" assistance);  and

(c) assistance in an emergency involving risk to life in the
expedition ("emergency" assistance);

Desirous  of establishing a common practice with regard to such
non-governmental expeditions as may, in their planning stages,
approach their offices responsible for their national Antarctic
organization for planned assistance or may approach stations in 
the Antarctic for necessary assistance to remedy deficiencies in 
their provisions;

Recognizing  that the common Antarctic principle of help being
freely given in the event of an emergency request for assistance
must apply without regard to who asks for it;

Recognising  that national Antarctic organizations are financed
by public funds for the purpose of conducting scientific
research and supporting agreed international scientific projects
and that resources made available to non-governmental
expeditions are likely to be at the expense of the primary
purposes of such programmes;

Recognising  that inadequate provisioning on the part of a
non-governmental expedition or an emergency involving such an
expedition may entail diversion of resources from their planned
purpose, disruption of scientific programmes and risk to the
personnel and equipment of national Antarctic organizations;

Aware  of the grave difficulties and possible dangers likely to
befall any inexperienced or inadequately organised
non-governmental expedition;

Recognising  that the provision of assistance to remedy
deficiencies and the humanitarian duty to respond to an
emergency involving a non-governmental expedition may, in the
event, need to be undertaken by a national Antarctic
organization of a Consultative Party other than the one in which
it was organized or which assisted the non-governmental
expedition in question;
.

Recognizing that a non-governmental expedition may request assistance from a national Antarctic organization of a country other than that in which it is organized and that the government of the Consultative Party in whose territory it is organized is better placed to assess the purposes and planning of the non-governmental expedition in question;

Affirming that, in respect of non-governmental expeditions Contracting Parties shall, in accordance with Article X of the Antarctic Treaty, exert appropriate efforts to the end that no one engages in any activity in Antarctica contrary to the principles or purposes of the Treaty;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They take such steps as are open to them to enquire as to the objectives and plans of non-governmental expeditions of which they may become aware and they circulate to Consultative Parties the results of their enquiries.

2. They provide to any non-governmental expedition of which they may become aware a copy of this Recommendation and a copy of the "Statement of Accepted Practices and the Relevant Provisions of the Antarctic Treaty" referred to in Part I of Recommendation X-8.

3. They further emphasize to any non-governmental expedition of which they may become aware the following considerations reflecting the common attitude of Consultative Parties and their national Antarctic organizations towards such expeditions:

(i)  governmental facilities and resources in Antarctica are committed to support of national and agreed international programs with little or no excess capacity;

(ii)  the proposed expedition may interfere with ongoing scientific programs and their supporting activities unless entirely self-sufficient;

(iii)  any need for emergency assistance from governmental facilities or resources in Antarctica would at best be disruptive of ongoing programs and at worst lead to loss of life or critical resources or both;

(iv)  their proposed activities should be planned for total self-sufficiency in transport, logistic support, communications, accommodation and emergency assistance.

4.  No office responsible for a national Antarctic organization shall provide planned assistance to a non-governmental expedition organized in the territory of another Consultative Party to the Antarctic Treaty without first consulting, through diplomatic channels, the Government of the Consultative Party in whose territory the expedition is being organized.

5.  They urge any non-governmental expedition of which they may become aware to consult with the Government of the Consultative Party in whose territory it is being organized and to lodge with it a guarantee, supported by

insurance against the risk of incurring financial charges
or material losses in the Antarctic Treaty Area so that
the expedition will be able to reimburse to any national
Antarctic organization the costs of any necessary
assistance for which it may call.

6. Nothing in of this Recommendation shall be interpreted as
prejudicing.

(a) the humanitarian obligation of national Antarctic
programmes to respond to emergency requests for
assistance in accordance with Recommendation
I-X; or

(b) the right of any office responsible for a
national Antarctic programme to decide that it
will not assist a non-governmental expedition.
