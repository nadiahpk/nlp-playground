DRAFT RECOMMENDATION (Submitted by Australia) - MANS'S IMPACT ON
THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT (Item 6)

The Representatives,

Recalling  Recommendation VIII-11;

Desiring  to draw attention to the potential environmental
impacts of Antarctic expeditions and station activities;

Noting  a general increase amongst ATCPs in awareness of the
potential impacts of waste disposal in the Antarctic region;

Recommend  to their Governments that to the greatest extent
feasible they observe the code of conduct annexed to this
Recommendation at their stations and for their activities in the
Antarctic Treaty Area.

CODE OF CONDUCT FOR ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONS AND STATION ACTIVITIES
(Item 4)
(Submitted by Australia)
(Suggested changes are underlined)

1. Waste Disposal

The following are recommended procedures:

(a) Solid Waste (*Note: reference to batteries has been
deleted)

    (i)    Non-combustible, including chemicals.

           These materials should be returned to the
operator's country to the greatest extent possible.
Alternatively, those containing non-harmful chemicals may
be disposed of at sea either in deep water or, if this is
not possible, at specified sites in shallow water.

    (ii)   Combustibles

    -     Wood, wood products and paper should be
incinerated, the ash being returned, to the
extent possible, to the operator's home country.
Alternatively the ash should be disposed of at
sea;

    -     Lubricating oils may be burnt, except those
containing harmful additives which should be
removed from the Treaty Area;

-   Carcasses and materials associated with
imported experimental animals should be
incinerated;

-   All plastics and rubber products should be
removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area.

(b) Liquid Waste

(i)    Human waste, garbage and laundry effluents should
receive the highest degree of treatment practicable, with
maceration and flushing into the sea as a desirable
minimum.

(ii)   Large quantities of photographic liquids should
be treated for the recovery of silver and the residue
should be flushed into the sea.

(c) The above procedures are recommended for coastal
stations.  Field sites supported from coastal stations
should, where feasible, use the facilities of their
supporting station.  Inland stations should concentrate all
waste in deep pits.  Except as stated for inland stations,
waste should not be buried.

(d) Waste containing radio-isotopes should be removed from
the Antarctic Treaty Area.

(e) Every effort should be made to reduce the plastic
packaging of products imported into the Antarctic Treaty
Area.

(f) If possible the use of leaded fuels or fuels containing
ethylene bromide and ethylene chloride should be avoided.

(g) When incinerators are used it is desirable to monitor the
effluents.

2. Introduction of alien species

Procedures to safeguard against the introduction of azlien
species are covered by Article IX of the Agreed Measures for the
Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

3. Disturbance of breeding colonies and concentration of birds
and mammals

Procedures to minimise such disturbances are covered by
Article VII of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of
Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

4. Guidelines for Antarctic operating organizations planning
major Antarctic Projects

(a) In the planning of major operations in the Antarctic
Treaty Area an evaluation of the environmental impact of the
proposed activity should be carried out by the Antarctic
operating organisations concerned. Such an evaluation should
include:

(i) A description of the proposed action and an
assessment of its potential benefits and its possible
impact on the relevant ecosystems.

4.

(ii) A consideration of alternative actions which
might alter the pattern of benefits versus adverse
environmental effects expected to result from the action.

(b) These evaluations may be circulated for information
through SCAR channels to all the states engaged in Antarctic
activities.
