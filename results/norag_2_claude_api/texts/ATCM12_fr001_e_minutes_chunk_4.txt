Activities of Countries not Party to the Antarctic Treaty
(Agenda Item 9)

31. There was a discussion of the inclusion, on the proposal
of Malaysia and Antigua and Barbuda, of an item on Antarctica on
the agenda for the 38th session of the United Nations General
Assembly. Consultative Parties unanimously reaffirmed their
commitment to the Antarctic Treaty and expressed their concern
that any attempts to modify or replace the Treaty would be
likely to introduce contention and instability into a region of
hitherto unparalleled peace and international co-operation.
