The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendation X-3;

Having received with great pleasure and attention Volumes I and
II of the Manual of the S.C.A.R. Logistics Group, which
constitutes a technical effort deserving to be tested to assess
its content and to be constantly updated in order to satisfy
the ends to which it has been prepared;

Recognising that the Antarctic region and the Antarctic continent
itself represent a vast area of the Southern Hemisphere
generating meteorological phenomena that exert considerable
influence over the climate of the remaining continents;

Bearing in mind that the number of meteorological stations
existing in Antarctica are small in relation to the size of the
region and, in many cases, are concentrated in certain areas
having easy access by sea;

Considering that, consequently, there exists no rationally
distributed network of meteorological data-receiving stations
throughout the length and breadth of the whole continent to
cover the need for information on the evolution of meteorological
phenomena and their influence on the weather forecasts of the
region and other areas of the Southern Hemisphere;

Recognising that an optimal distribution of stations constitutes
a solution which is scarcely feasible and would, furthermore,
represent high installation costs;

Taking into account, moreover, that the efficiency of existing
networks, both for data collection and for the transmission
of meteorological information from each station to the other
bases, to vessels operating in the Southern Ocean and to aircraft
