Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment  (Agenda Item 6)

11.     Draft Recommendations had been tabled by Argentina and
Chile about the connection between the Antarctic Treaty itself
and instruments derived from it, by Australia proposing
amendments to the Code of Conduct for Antarctic Expeditions and

Station Activities annexed to Recommendation VIII-11 and by the
United Kingdom calling for the adoption nationally, on an
experimental basis, of broadly defined procedures for the
assessment of the environmental impact of such activities of
national Antarctic expeditions which might have impacts which
were significant. In addition, Australia tabled a discussion
paper raising the question of whether there needed to be a
greater degree of coherence between measures for the protection
of the Antarctic environment adopted under the Antarctic Treaty
and instruments derived from the Treaty.

12. An Environmental Group was convened under the
chairmanship of Mr C.D. Beeby (New Zealand) which gave detailed
examination to all these proposals.

13. It was felt that, in a broad sense, the Argentine and
Chilean draft Recommendation and the Australian discussion paper
addressed similar concerns and should be treated together. In
debate, it was recognised that there was a need to consider
whether further co-ordination was necessary of the various
elements of environmental protection and conservation contained
in the Antarctic Treaty system.

14. Regarding the Australian draft recommendation on the Code
of Conduct it was agreed to refer to national Antarctic programs
the questions of problems in implementing the Code of Conduct
and of the desirability and feasibility of revising the Code of
Conduct (see Recommendation XII-4).

15. Regarding the United Kingdom's draft recommendation, it
was felt that the issues dealt with in the draft should be
referred to SCAR for advice. While it was noted that some
governments already subject their Antarctic programs to impact
assessment procedures, other Representatives felt that there was
a need to move cautiously in search of whatever element of
comparability it might be found prudent to apply, on a national
basis, to such procedures (see Recommendation XII-3).

16. It was noted that the material set out in paragraphs 17
to 19 below, consisting of a description of the practice of a
number of countries in relation to environmental assessment
procedures, might be of value to SCAR in considering the issues
referred to it by Recommendation XII-3. It was further noted
that the Consultative Parties and National Committees of SCAR
might wish to forward to SCAR additional material relating to
their own procedures.

Environmental Impact Assessments

17. Among the steps found in some national environmental
impact assessment procedures are the following:

(i) definition of criteria to be used in determining whether
proposed activities have a significant impact on the
environment;

(ii) clear definition and description of the proposed
activity;

(iii) a first evaluation, performed by the organisation
responsible for the activity, of whether the proposal
might reasonably be expected to have a significant
impact;

(iv) if the result of such a preliminary evaluation is that
the proposed activity is likely to have no more than a
minor or transitory effect on the environment, the
activity would proceed;

(v) if the preliminary evaluation indicates that a proposed
activity is likely to have significant impacts on the
environment, an environmental assessment of the proposed
activity would be made;

8.

(vi)  such an assessment might be expected to include:

(a)  description of the proposed activity as well as
     feasible alternatives including the consequences
     of not proceeding;

(b)  description of the initial reference state with
     which predicted changes are to be compared and a
     prediction of future environmental states in the
     absence of action;

(c)  estimation of the nature and magnitudes of the
     likely environmental changes resulting from the
     proposed activity;

(d)  definition of the criteria to be used in
     measuring the significance of environmental
     changes, including the relative weighting to be
     assigned in comparing different kinds of changes;

(e)  estimation of the significance of the predicted
     changes;

(vii)  a decision would then be made on the basis of the
       assessment as to whether or not the activity should
       proceed in its original or a modified form, and this
       decision and the reasons for it would be notified to
       those interested or affected;  and

(viii) implementation of the accepted action.

18.  Monitoring of key indicators of the environmental effects
of such activities is an important element and may call for
modification of the activity.

9.

19. Where appropriate, the assessment procedures described above might also be expected to include the following steps:

(a) consideration of indirect or second order effects;

(b) consideration of the cumulative impacts of the proposed activity in the light of existing activities;

(c) description of any measures to be taken to maintain environmental quality; and

(d) description of the manner in which restoration of the environment would be achieved.
